Armstrong, Kaiming Cui, Marina Lafarga Magro, Luis Agustín Nieto, Rodrigo F. Díaz, Lauren Doyle, Vedad Kunovac</br>Comments: Submitted to MNRAS. Comments from the community are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We present RAVEN, a newly developed vetting and validation pipeline for TESS
exoplanet candidates. The pipeline employs a Bayesian framework to derive the
posterior probability of a candidate being a planet against a set of False
Positive (FP) scenarios, through the use of a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree
and a Gaussian Process classifier, trained on comprehensive synthetic training
sets of simulated planets and 8 astrophysical FP scenarios injected into TESS
lightcurves. These training sets allow large scale candidate vetting and
performance verification against individual FP scenarios. A Non-Simulated FP
training set consisting of real TESS candidates caused primarily by stellar
variability and systematic noise is also included. The machine learning derived
probabilities are combined with scenario specific prior probabilities,
including the candidates' positional probabilities, to compute the final
posterior probabilities. Candidates with a planetary posterior probability
greater than 99% against each FP scenario and whose implied planetary radius is
less than 8$R_{\oplus}$ are considered to be statistically validated by the
pipeline. In this first version, the pipeline has been developed for candidates
with a lightcurve released from the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre,
an orbital period between 0.5 and 16 days and a transit depth greater than
300ppm. The pipeline obtained area-under-curve (AUC) scores > 97% on all FP
scenarios and > 99% on all but one. Testing on an independent external sample
of 1361 pre-classified TOIs, the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 91%,
demonstrating its effectiveness for automated ranking of TESS candidates. For a
probability threshold of 0.9 the pipeline reached a precision of 97% with a
recall score of 66% on these TOIs. The RAVEN pipeline is publicly released as a
cloud-hosted app, making it easily accessible to the community.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20310v1"><h2>Deep learning for exoplanet detection and characterization by direct
  imaging at high contrast</h2></a>Authors:  Théo Bodrito, Olivier Flasseur, Julien Mairal, Jean Ponce, Maud Langlois, Anne-Marie Lagrange</br>Comments: SF2A 2025</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>Exoplanet imaging is a major challenge in astrophysics due to the need for
high angular resolution and high contrast. We present a multi-scale statistical
model for the nuisance component corrupting multivariate image series at high
contrast. Integrated into a learnable architecture, it leverages the physics of
the problem and enables the fusion of multiple observations of the same star in
a way that is optimal in terms of detection signal-to-noise ratio. Applied to
data from the VLT/SPHERE instrument, the method significantly improves the
detection sensitivity and the accuracy of astrometric and photometric
estimation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20447v1"><h2>Neural Networks as Surrogate Solvers for Time-Dependent Accretion Disk
  Dynamics</h2></a>Authors:  Shunyuan Mao, Weiqi Wang, Sifan Wang, Ruobing Dong, Lu Lu, Kwang Moo Yi, Paris Perdikaris, Andrea Isella, Sébastien Fabbro, Lile Wang</br>Comments: Astrophysical Journal Letters accepted; associate animations are
  available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30192904</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse
environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic
nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally
intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains
neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the
first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent
hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide
solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and
successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and
propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion
interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally
eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging
to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced
machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of
complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to
traditional numerical simulations in the future.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19494v1"><h2>Testing the Constancy of Type Ia Supernova Luminosities with Gaussian
  Process</h2></a>Authors:  Akshay Rana</br>Comments: 14 Pages, 04 Figures, Under review</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, physics.data-an, stat.ME</br><p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia) are central to studies of cosmic expansion, under
the assumption that their absolute magnitude $M_B$ does not evolve with
redshift. Even small drifts in brightness can bias cosmological parameters such
as $H_0$ and $w$. Here we test this assumption using a non-parametric Gaussian
Process (GP) reconstruction of the expansion history from cosmic chronometer
$H(z)$ data, which provides a model-independent baseline distance modulus,
$\mu_{\rm GP}(z)$. To propagate uncertainties, we draw Monte Carlo realizations
of $H(z)$ from the GP posterior and evaluate them on a Chebyshev grid, which
improves numerical stability and quadrature accuracy. Supernova observations
are then compared to this baseline through residuals, $\Delta M_B(z)$, and
their derivatives. Applying this method to Pantheon+ (1701 SNe~Ia) and DES 5YR
(435 SNe~Ia), we find that SNe~Ia are consistent with being standard candles
within $1\sigma$, though both datasets exhibit localized departures: near $z
\sim 1$ in Pantheon+ and at $z \sim 0.3$--$0.5$ in DES. The presence of similar
features in two independent surveys suggests they are not purely statistical.
Our results point toward a possible non-monotonic luminosity evolution, likely
reflecting different physical drivers at different epochs, and highlight the
need for a deeper astrophysical understanding of SN~Ia populations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19453v1"><h2>The Platonic Universe: Do Foundation Models See the Same Sky?</h2></a>Authors:  UniverseTBD, :, Kshitij Duraphe, Michael J. Smith, Shashwat Sourav, John F. Wu</br>Comments: 9 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure. Accepted as a workshop paper to Machine
  Learning and the Physical Sciences at NeurIPS 2025</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We test the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) in astronomy by
measuring representational convergence across a range of foundation models
trained on different data types. Using spectroscopic and imaging observations
from JWST, HSC, Legacy Survey, and DESI, we compare representations from vision
transformers, self-supervised models, and astronomy-specific architectures via
mutual $k$-nearest neighbour analysis. We observe consistent scaling:
representational alignment generally increases with model capacity across our
tested architectures, supporting convergence toward a shared representation of
galaxy astrophysics. Our results suggest that astronomical foundation models
can use pre-trained general-purpose architectures, allowing us to capitalise on
the broader machine learning community's already-spent computational
investment.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18214v1"><h2>Automatic Classification of Magnetic Chirality of Solar Filaments from
  H-Alpha Observations</h2></a>Authors:  Alexis Chalmers, Azim Ahmadzadeh</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.AI</br><p>In this study, we classify the magnetic chirality of solar filaments from
H-Alpha observations using state-of-the-art image classification models. We
establish the first reproducible baseline for solar filament chirality
classification on the MAGFiLO dataset. The MAGFiLO dataset contains over 10,000
manually-annotated filaments from GONG H-Alpha observations, making it the
largest dataset for filament detection and classification to date. Prior
studies relied on much smaller datasets, which limited their generalizability
and comparability. We fine-tuned several pre-trained, image classification
architectures, including ResNet, WideResNet, ResNeXt, and ConvNeXt, and also
applied data augmentation and per-class loss weights to optimize the models.
Our best model, ConvNeXtBase, achieves a per-class accuracy of 0.69 for left
chirality filaments and $0.73$ for right chirality filaments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18444v1"><h2>Complexity-entropy analysis of solar photospheric turbulence: Hinode
  images of magnetic and Poynting fluxes</h2></a>Authors:  Abraham C. -L. Chian, Haroldo V. Ribeiro, Erico L. Rempel, Rodrigo A. Miranda, Luis B. Rubio, Milan Gošić, Breno Raphaldini, Yasuhito Narita</br>Comments: 4 two-column pages, 3 figures, supplementary information; accepted
  for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, physics.data-an, physics.space-ph</br><p>The spatiotemporal inhomogeneous-homogeneous transition in the dynamics and
structures of solar photospheric turbulence is studied by applying the
complexity-entropy analysis to Hinode images of a vortical region of
supergranular junctions in the quiet Sun. During a period of supergranular
vortex expansion of 37.5 min, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the line-of-sight
magnetic field and the horizontal electromagnetic energy flux display the
characteristics of inverse turbulent cascade, evidenced by the formation of a
large magnetic coherent structure via the merger of two small magnetic elements
trapped by a long-duration vortex. Both magnetic and Poynting fluxes exhibit an
admixture of chaos and stochasticity in the complexity-entropy plane, involving
a temporal transition from low to high complexity and a temporal transition
from high to low entropy during the period of vortex expansion, consistent with
Hinode observations.</p></br>
