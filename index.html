  Peculiar Dwarfs Using Machine Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Tianxing Zhou, Christopher A. Theissen, S. Jean Feeser, William M. J. Best, Adam J. Burgasser, Kelle L. Cruz, Lexu Zhao</br>Comments: 35 pages, 24 figures, 9 tables, accepted for publication in The

a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and
demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the
classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of
spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral
indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated
approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as
large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets
containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in
spectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\sim$ 120) near-infrared
spectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared
Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and
metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as
input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built
using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor
(KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed
the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and
metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN)
classifies 95.5 $\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface
gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the
dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources
with SNR $\gtrsim$ 60 have $\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy. We also find that zy-band
plays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the
highest feature importance.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09689v1"><h2>Machine Learning for Exoplanet Detection: A Comparative Analysis Using
  Kepler Data</h2></a>Authors:  Reihaneh Karimi, Mahdiyar Mousavi-Sadr, Mohammad H. Zhoolideh Haghighi, Fatemeh S. Tabatabaei</br>Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, Accepted for publication in Iranian
  Journal of Astronomy and Astrophysics (IJAA)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of planetary
systems and opened new avenues for astronomical research. In this study, we
present a machine learning (ML) framework for exoplanet identification using a
time-series photometric dataset from the Kepler Space Telescope, comprising
3,198 flux measurements across 5,074 stars. We investigate the performance of
four supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive
set of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area
Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion
matrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the
highest accuracy (99.8\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior
generalization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\%
accuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\%
accuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and
generalization at 95.8\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority
Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all
models by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the
effectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly
Random Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated
exoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for
implementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National
Observatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further
advance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07065v1"><h2>Reconstruction of Solar EUV Irradiance Using CaII K Images and SOHO/SEM
  Data with Bayesian Deep Learning and Uncertainty Quantification</h2></a>Authors:  Haodi Jiang, Qin Li, Jason T. L. Wang, Haimin Wang, Serena Criscuoli</br>Comments: 18 pages, 10 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance plays a crucial role in heating
the Earth's ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere, affecting atmospheric
dynamics over varying time scales. Although significant effort has been spent
studying short-term EUV variations from solar transient events, there is little
work to explore the long-term evolution of the EUV flux over multiple solar
cycles. Continuous EUV flux measurements have only been available since 1995,
leaving significant gaps in earlier data. In this study, we propose a Bayesian
deep learning model, named SEMNet, to fill the gaps. We validate our approach
by applying SEMNet to construct SOHO/SEM EUV flux measurements in the period
between 1998 and 2014 using CaII K images from the Precision Solar Photometric
Telescope. We then extend SEMNet through transfer learning to reconstruct solar
EUV irradiance in the period between 1950 and 1960 using CaII K images from the
Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. Experimental results show that SEMNet provides
reliable predictions along with uncertainty bounds, demonstrating the
feasibility of CaII K images as a robust proxy for long-term EUV fluxes. These
findings contribute to a better understanding of solar influences on Earth's
climate over extended periods.</p></br>
