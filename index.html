  Forecasting</h2></a>Authors:  Maher A Dayeh, Michael J Starkey, Subhamoy Chatterjee, Heather Elliott, Samuel Hart, Kimberly Moreland</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Space weather forecasting is critical for mitigating radiation risks in space
exploration and protecting Earth-based technologies from geomagnetic
disturbances. This paper presents the development of a Machine Learning (ML)-
ready data processing tool for Near Real-Time (NRT) space weather forecasting.
By merging data from diverse NRT sources such as solar imagery, magnetic field
measurements, and energetic particle fluxes, the tool addresses key gaps in
current space weather prediction capabilities. The tool processes and
structures the data for machine learning models, focusing on time-series
forecasting and event detection for extreme solar events. It provides users
with a framework to download, process, and label data for ML applications,
streamlining the workflow for improved NRT space weather forecasting and
scientific research.</p></br>
