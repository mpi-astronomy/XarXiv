in terms of Bertrand's class of time-frequency distributions. In this
representation, the detector is a correlation between the corresponding
time-frequency distributions. Since Bertrand's class is related to the
power-law chirp signals, the new representation can be useful for their
detection. The new approach is shown to be more effective then other
time-frequency methods for the case of phase-insensitive detection. The finding
provides a complementary representation to Cohen's class representation in the
time-frequency domain already known in the literature.</p></br>
