  a Transformer-Based Algorithm</h2></a>Authors:  Helem Salinas, Rafael Brahm, Greg Olmschenk, Richard K. Barry, Karim Pichara, Stela Ishitani Silva, Vladimir Araujo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is surveying a large
fraction of the sky, generating a vast database of photometric time series data
that requires thorough analysis to identify exoplanetary transit signals.
Automated learning approaches have been successfully applied to identify
transit signals. However, most existing methods focus on the classification and
validation of candidates, while few efforts have explored new techniques for
the search of candidates. To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we
propose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for
phase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those
observed in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new
neural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image
(FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally
developed for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated
significant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous
approaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ
multi-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from
the complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series,
without requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn
characteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps
distinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model
successfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122
multi-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from
TESS sectors 1-26 with a radius > 0.27 $R_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating
its ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07259v1"><h2>Flat U-Net: An Efficient Ultralightweight Model for Solar Filament
  Segmentation in Full-disk H$Î±$ Images</h2></a>Authors:  GaoFei Zhu, GangHua Lin, Xiao Yang, Cheng Zeng</br>Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in ApJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.CV, cs.LG</br><p>Solar filaments are one of the most prominent features observed on the Sun,
and their evolutions are closely related to various solar activities, such as
flares and coronal mass ejections. Real-time automated identification of solar
filaments is the most effective approach to managing large volumes of data.
Existing models of filament identification are characterized by large parameter
sizes and high computational costs, which limit their future applications in
highly integrated and intelligent ground-based and space-borne observation
devices. Consequently, the design of more lightweight models will facilitate
the advancement of intelligent observation equipment. In this study, we
introduce Flat U-Net, a novel and highly efficient ultralightweight model that
incorporates simplified channel attention (SCA) and channel self-attention
(CSA) convolutional blocks for the segmentation of solar filaments in full-disk
H$\alpha$ images. Feature information from each network layer is fully
extracted to reconstruct interchannel feature representations. Each block
effectively optimizes the channel features from the previous layer,
significantly reducing parameters. The network architecture presents an elegant
flattening, improving its efficiency, and simplifying the overall design.
Experimental validation demonstrates that a model composed of pure SCAs
achieves a precision of approximately 0.93, with dice similarity coefficient
(DSC) and recall rates of 0.76 and 0.64, respectively, significantly
outperforming the classical U-Net. Introducing a certain number of CSA blocks
improves the DSC and recall rates to 0.82 and 0.74, respectively, which
demonstrates a pronounced advantage, particularly concerning model weight size
and detection effectiveness. The data set, models, and code are available as
open-source resources.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08555v1"><h2>A Machine Learning-Ready Data Processing Tool for Near Real-Time
  Forecasting</h2></a>Authors:  Maher A Dayeh, Michael J Starkey, Subhamoy Chatterjee, Heather Elliott, Samuel Hart, Kimberly Moreland</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Space weather forecasting is critical for mitigating radiation risks in space
exploration and protecting Earth-based technologies from geomagnetic
disturbances. This paper presents the development of a Machine Learning (ML)-
ready data processing tool for Near Real-Time (NRT) space weather forecasting.
By merging data from diverse NRT sources such as solar imagery, magnetic field
measurements, and energetic particle fluxes, the tool addresses key gaps in
current space weather prediction capabilities. The tool processes and
structures the data for machine learning models, focusing on time-series
forecasting and event detection for extreme solar events. It provides users
with a framework to download, process, and label data for ML applications,
streamlining the workflow for improved NRT space weather forecasting and
scientific research.</p></br>
