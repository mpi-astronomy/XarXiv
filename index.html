  description length</h2></a>Authors:  Harry Desmond</br>Comments: 15 pages, 4 figures; Invited review for the Royal Society
  Philosophical Transactions A special issue "Symbolic regression in the
  physical sciences"</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions
from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will
describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an
unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good
function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in
their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive
search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which
allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in
units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive
Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the
expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in
galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm
identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general
purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11400v1"><h2>The model is the message: Lightweight convolutional autoencoders applied
  to noisy imaging data for planetary science and astrobiology</h2></a>Authors:  Caleb Scharf</br>Comments: 28 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Icarus</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The application of convolutional autoencoder deep learning to imaging data
for planetary science and astrobiological use is briefly reviewed and explored
with a focus on the need to understand algorithmic rationale, process, and
results when machine learning is utilized. Successful autoencoders train to
build a model that captures the features of data in a dimensionally reduced
form (the latent representation) that can then be used to recreate the original
input. One application is the reconstruction of incomplete or noisy data. Here
a baseline, lightweight convolutional autoencoder is used to examine the
utility for planetary image reconstruction or inpainting in situations where
there is destructive random noise (i.e., either luminance noise with zero
returned data in some image pixels, or color noise with random additive levels
across pixel channels). It is shown that, in certain use cases, multi-color
image reconstruction can be usefully applied even with extensive random
destructive noise with 90% areal coverage and higher. This capability is
discussed in the context of intentional masking to reduce data bandwidth, or
situations with low-illumination levels and other factors that obscure image
data (e.g., sensor degradation or atmospheric conditions). It is further
suggested that for some scientific use cases the model latent space and
representations have more utility than large raw imaging datasets.</p></br>
