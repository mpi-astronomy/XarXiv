  Approach AI Astrophysicist</h2></a>Authors:  Cunshi Wang, Xinjie Hu, Yu Zhang, Xunhao Chen, Pengliang Du, Yiming Mao, Rui Wang, Yuyang Li, Ying Wu, Hang Yang, Yansong Li, Beichuan Wang, Haiyang Mu, Zheng Wang, Jianfeng Tian, Liang Ge, Yongna Mao, Shengming Li, Xiaomeng Lu, Jinhang Zou, Yang Huang, Ningchen Sun, Jie Zheng, Min He, Yu Bai, Junjie Jin, Hong Wu, Chaohui Shang, Jifeng Liu</br>Comments: 21 pages, 18 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.CL</br><p>With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents
have introduced convenient and user-friendly methods for leveraging tools
across various domains. In the field of astronomical observation, the
construction of new telescopes has significantly increased astronomers'
workload. Deploying LLM-powered agents can effectively alleviate this burden
and reduce the costs associated with training personnel. Within the Nearby
Galaxy Supernovae Survey (NGSS) project, which encompasses eight telescopes
across three observation sites, aiming to find the transients from the galaxies
in 50 mpc, we have developed the \textbf{StarWhisper Telescope System} to
manage the entire observation process. This system automates tasks such as
generating observation lists, conducting observations, analyzing data, and
providing feedback to the observer. Observation lists are customized for
different sites and strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of celestial
objects. After manual verification, these lists are uploaded to the telescopes
via the agents in the system, which initiates observations upon neutral
language. The observed images are analyzed in real-time, and the transients are
promptly communicated to the observer. The agent modifies them into a real-time
follow-up observation proposal and send to the Xinglong observatory group chat,
then add them to the next-day observation lists. Additionally, the integration
of AI agents within the system provides online accessibility, saving
astronomers' time and encouraging greater participation from amateur
astronomers in the NGSS project.</p></br>
