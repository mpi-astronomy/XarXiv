understanding their evolution. The novel binary population synthesis code
POSYDON includes a module for interpolating the stellar and binary properties
of any system at the end of binary MESA evolution based on a pre-computed set
of models. In this work, we present a new emulation method for predicting
stellar profiles, i.e., the internal stellar structure along the radial axis,
using machine learning techniques. We use principal component analysis for
dimensionality reduction and fully-connected feed-forward neural networks for
making predictions. We find accuracy to be comparable to that of nearest
neighbor approximation, with a strong advantage in terms of memory and storage
efficiency. By delivering more information about the evolution of stellar
internal structure, these emulators will enable faster simulations of higher
physical fidelity with large-scale simulations of binary star population
synthesis possible with POSYDON and other population synthesis codes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11911v1"><h2>Transfer Learning Adapts to Changing PSD in Gravitational Wave Data</h2></a>Authors:  Beka Modrekiladze</br>Comments: 7 pages, 3 figures</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>The detection of gravitational waves has opened unparalleled opportunities
for observing the universe, particularly through the study of black hole
inspirals. These events serve as unique laboratories to explore the laws of
physics under conditions of extreme energies. However, significant noise in
gravitational wave (GW) data from observatories such as Advanced LIGO and Virgo
poses major challenges in signal identification. Traditional noise suppression
methods often fall short in fully addressing the non-Gaussian effects in the
data, including the fluctuations in noise power spectral density (PSD) over
short time intervals. These challenges have led to the exploration of an AI
approach that, while overcoming previous obstacles, introduced its own
challenges, such as scalability, reliability issues, and the vanishing gradient
problem. Our approach addresses these issues through a simplified architecture.
To compensate for the potential limitations of a simpler model, we have
developed a novel training methodology that enables it to accurately detect
gravitational waves amidst highly complex noise. Employing this strategy, our
model achieves over 99% accuracy in non-white noise scenarios and shows
remarkable adaptability to changing noise PSD conditions. By leveraging the
principles of transfer learning, our model quickly adapts to new noise profiles
with just a few epochs of fine-tuning, facilitating real-time applications in
dynamically changing noise environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10009v1"><h2>Enhancing Peer Review in Astronomy: A Machine Learning and Optimization
  Approach to Reviewer Assignments for ALMA</h2></a>Authors:  John M. Carpenter, Andrea Corvill√≥n, Nihar B. Shah</br>Comments: 19 pages, 5 figures, submitted to PASP</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.DL</br><p>The increasing volume of papers and proposals undergoing peer review
emphasizes the pressing need for greater automation to effectively manage the
growing scale. In this study, we present the deployment and evaluation of
machine learning and optimization techniques for assigning proposals to
reviewers that was developed for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) during the Cycle 10 Call for Proposals issued in 2023. By
utilizing topic modeling algorithms, we identify the proposal topics and assess
reviewers' expertise based on their historical ALMA proposal submissions. We
then apply an adapted version of the assignment optimization algorithm from
PeerReview4All (Stelmakh et al. 2021a) to maximize the alignment between
proposal topics and reviewer expertise. Our evaluation shows a significant
improvement in matching reviewer expertise: the median similarity score between
the proposal topic and reviewer expertise increased by 51 percentage points
compared to the previous cycle, and the percentage of reviewers reporting
expertise in their assigned proposals rose by 20 percentage points.
Furthermore, the assignment process proved highly effective in that no
proposals required reassignment due to significant mismatches, resulting in a
savings of 3 to 5 days of manual effort.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10606v1"><h2>Evaluating Sparse Galaxy Simulations via Out-of-Distribution Detection
  and Amortized Bayesian Model Comparison</h2></a>Authors:  Lingyi Zhou, Stefan T. Radev, William H. Oliver, Aura Obreja, Zehao Jin, Tobias Buck</br>Comments: accepted to the Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences workshop
  at Neurips 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an, physics.space-ph</br><p>Cosmological simulations are a powerful tool to advance our understanding of
galaxy formation and many simulations model key properties of real galaxies. A
question that naturally arises for such simulations in light of high-quality
observational data is: How close are the models to reality? Due to the
high-dimensionality of the problem, many previous studies evaluate galaxy
simulations using simplified summary statistics of physical properties. In this
work, we combine simulation-based Bayesian model comparison with a novel
misspecification detection technique to compare simulated galaxy images of 6
hydrodynamical models observations. Since cosmological simulations are
computationally costly, we address the problem of low simulation budgets by
first training a $k$-sparse variational autoencoder (VAE) on the abundant
dataset of SDSS images. The VAE learns to extract informative latent embeddings
and delineates the typical set of real images. To reveal simulation gaps, we
then perform out-of-distribution detection (OOD) based on the logits of
classifiers trained on the embeddings of simulated images. Finally, we perform
amortized Bayesian model comparison using probabilistic classification,
identifying the relatively best-performing model along with partial
explanations through SHAP values.</p></br>
