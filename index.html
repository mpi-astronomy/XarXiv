  Network</h2></a>Authors:  Bo Liang, Hanlin Song, Chang Liu, Tianyu Zhao, Yuxiang Xu, Zihao Xiao, Manjia Liang, Minghui Du, Wei-Liang Qian, Li-e Qiang, Peng Xu, Ziren Luo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>In this work, we propose a new flow-matching Markov chain Monte Carlo
(FM-MCMC) algorithm for estimating the orbital parameters of exoplanetary
systems, especially for those only one exoplanet is involved. Compared to
traditional methods that rely on random sampling within the Bayesian framework,
our approach first leverages flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) to
efficiently constrain the prior range of physical parameters, and then employs
MCMC to accurately infer the posterior distribution. For example, in the
orbital parameter inference of beta Pictoris b, our model achieved a
substantial speed-up while maintaining comparable accuracy-running 77.8 times
faster than Parallel Tempered MCMC (PTMCMC) and 365.4 times faster than nested
sampling. Moreover, our FM-MCMC method also attained the highest average
log-likelihood among all approaches, demonstrating its superior sampling
efficiency and accuracy. This highlights the scalability and efficiency of our
approach, making it well-suited for processing the massive datasets expected
from future exoplanet surveys. Beyond astrophysics, our methodology establishes
a versatile paradigm for synergizing deep generative models with traditional
sampling, which can be adopted to tackle complex inference problems in other
fields, such as cosmology, biomedical imaging, and particle physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16955v1"><h2>On the use of the Derivative Approximation for Likelihoods for
  Gravitational Wave Inference</h2></a>Authors:  Josiel Mendonça Soares de Souza, Miguel Quartin</br>Comments: 26 pages, 14 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, physics.data-an</br><p>Posterior inference on the more than a dozen parameters governing a
gravitational wave (GW) event is challenging. A typical MCMC analysis can take
around $100$ CPU hours, and next generation GW observatories will detect many
thousands of events. Here we present a thorough comparison of the accuracy and
computational cost of the Fisher Matrix, Derivative Approximation for
Likelihoods (DALI) and traditional MCMC methods. We find that using DALI, which
extends the traditional Fisher Matrix (FM) method to higher orders, allows for
a good approximation of the posterior with a $55$ times smaller computational
cost, and that the cost-benefit of the doublet-DALI is better than that of the
triplet-DALI. We also show that the singlet-DALI, a hybrid MCMC-Fisher method,
is much more accurate than the traditional FM and 10 times faster than the
doublet-DALI. A large effort has been invested in forecasting the science case
of different detector configurations, and the ability of making fast yet
accurate estimations of the posteriors is an important step forward. We also
introduce version \texttt{1.0} of the public \texttt{GWDALI} code, which
incorporates automatic differentiation, modern waveforms and an optimized
parameter decomposition.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15116v1"><h2>Polarization based direction of arrival estimation using a radio
  interferometric array</h2></a>Authors:  Sarod Yatawatta</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized
arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the
operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are
designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality
images of the sky.
  Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary
geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically
infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper,
we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio
interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full
array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is
suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the
proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency
interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the
detected RFI.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14102v1"><h2>Extracting latent representations from X-ray spectra. Classification,
  regression, and accretion signatures of Chandra sources</h2></a>Authors:  Nicolò Oreste Pinciroli Vago, Juan Rafael Martínez-Galarza, Roberta Amato</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>The study of X-ray spectra is crucial to understanding the physical nature of
astrophysical sources. Machine learning methods can extract compact and
informative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source
Catalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains
largely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and
physically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep
learning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant
information, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and
interpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress
X-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only
high-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary
statistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned
representation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering
performance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with
physical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density
($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent
variables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification
accuracy of $\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\sim$69% when
restricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover,
latent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes,
suggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant
information. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the
representation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent
space that supports both classification and the estimation of physical
properties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral
studies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15198v1"><h2>HyperAIRI: a plug-and-play algorithm for precise hyperspectral image
  reconstruction in radio interferometry</h2></a>Authors:  Chao Tang, Arwa Dabbech, Adrian Jackson, Yves Wiaux</br>Comments: 18 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, eess.IV</br><p>The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging
algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from
large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a
plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure
(FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging
by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularisation step via learned
denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension,
underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral
model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its
current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighbouring
channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated
denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained
with a Jacobian regularisation enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate
varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each
tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral
channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using
dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are
also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability
to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a
variant of the optimisation-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity
across spectral channels via the l2,1-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate
HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its
superior performance compared to its optimisation-based counterpart
Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic
imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.</p></br>
