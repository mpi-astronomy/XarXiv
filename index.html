  Discovery from Simulations</h2></a>Authors:  Kai L. Polsterer, Bernd Doser, Andreas Fehlner, Sebastian Trujillo-Gomez</br>Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Simulations are the best approximation to experimental laboratories in
astrophysics and cosmology. However, the complexity, richness, and large size
of their outputs severely limit the interpretability of their predictions. We
describe a new, unbiased, and machine learning based approach to obtaining
useful scientific insights from a broad range of simulations. The method can be
used on today's largest simulations and will be essential to solve the extreme
data exploration and analysis challenges posed by the Exascale era.
Furthermore, this concept is so flexible, that it will also enable explorative
access to observed data. Our concept is based on applying nonlinear
dimensionality reduction to learn compact representations of the data in a
low-dimensional space. The simulation data is projected onto this space for
interactive inspection, visual interpretation, sample selection, and local
analysis. We present a prototype using a rotational invariant hyperspherical
variational convolutional autoencoder, utilizing a power distribution in the
latent space, and trained on galaxies from IllustrisTNG simulation. Thereby, we
obtain a natural Hubble tuning fork like similarity space that can be
visualized interactively on the surface of a sphere by exploiting the power of
HiPS tilings in Aladin Lite.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02785v1"><h2>Event-horizon-scale Imaging of M87* under Different Assumptions via Deep
  Generative Image Priors</h2></a>Authors:  Berthy T. Feng, Katherine L. Bouman, William T. Freeman</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, eess.IV</br><p>Reconstructing images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of
M87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, depends on a
prior to impose desired image statistics. However, given the impossibility of
directly observing black holes, there is no clear choice for a prior. We
present a framework for flexibly designing a range of priors, each bringing
different biases to the image reconstruction. These priors can be weak (e.g.,
impose only basic natural-image statistics) or strong (e.g., impose assumptions
of black-hole structure). Our framework uses Bayesian inference with
score-based priors, which are data-driven priors arising from a deep generative
model that can learn complicated image distributions. Using our Bayesian
imaging approach with sophisticated data-driven priors, we can assess how
visual features and uncertainty of reconstructed images change depending on the
prior. In addition to simulated data, we image the real EHT M87* data and
discuss how recovered features are influenced by the choice of prior.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04378v1"><h2>TIDMAD: Time Series Dataset for Discovering Dark Matter with AI
  Denoising</h2></a>Authors:  J. T. Fry, Aobo Li, Lindley Winslow, Xinyi Hope Fu, Zhenghao Fu, Kaliroe M. W. Pappas</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, hep-ex</br><p>Dark matter makes up approximately 85% of total matter in our universe, yet
it has never been directly observed in any laboratory on Earth. The origin of
dark matter is one of the most important questions in contemporary physics, and
a convincing detection of dark matter would be a Nobel-Prize-level breakthrough
in fundamental science. The ABRACADABRA experiment was specifically designed to
search for dark matter. Although it has not yet made a discovery, ABRACADABRA
has produced several dark matter search results widely endorsed by the physics
community. The experiment generates ultra-long time-series data at a rate of 10
million samples per second, where the dark matter signal would manifest itself
as a sinusoidal oscillation mode within the ultra-long time series. In this
paper, we present the TIDMAD -- a comprehensive data release from the
ABRACADABRA experiment including three key components: an ultra-long time
series dataset divided into training, validation, and science subsets; a
carefully-designed denoising score for direct model benchmarking; and a
complete analysis framework which produces a community-standard dark matter
search result suitable for publication as a physics paper. This data release
enables core AI algorithms to extract the signal and produce real physics
results thereby advancing fundamental science. The data downloading and
associated analysis scripts are available at
