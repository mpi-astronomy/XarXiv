  fields: applications to f(R) cosmologies</h2></a>Authors:  Julieth Katherine Riveros, Paola Saavedra, Hector J. Hortua, Jorge Enrique Garcia-Farieta, Ivan Olier</br>Comments: 13 pages comments welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.AI</br><p>Next-generation galaxy surveys promise unprecedented precision in testing
gravity at cosmological scales. However, realising this potential requires
accurately modelling the non-linear cosmic web. We address this challenge by
exploring conditional generative modelling to create 3D dark matter density
fields via score-based (diffusion) and flow-based methods. Our results
demonstrate the power of diffusion models to accurately reproduce the matter
power spectra and bispectra, even for unseen configurations. They also offer a
significant speed-up with slightly reduced accuracy, when flow-based
reconstructing the probability distribution function, but they struggle with
higher-order statistics. To improve conditional generation, we introduce a
novel multi-output model to develop feature representations of the cosmological
parameters. Our findings offer a powerful tool for exploring deviations from
standard gravity, combining high precision with reduced computational cost,
thus paving the way for more comprehensive and efficient cosmological analyses</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15066v1"><h2>An Interpretable Machine Learning Approach to Understanding the
  Relationships between Solar Flares and Source Active Regions</h2></a>Authors:  Huseyin Cavus, Jason T. L. Wang, Teja P. S. Singampalli, Gani Caglar Coban, Hongyang Zhang, Abd-ur Raheem, Haimin Wang</br>Comments: 16 pages, 9 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.LG, physics.space-ph</br><p>Solar flares are defined as outbursts on the surface of the Sun. They occur
when energy accumulated in magnetic fields enclosing solar active regions (ARs)
is abruptly expelled. Solar flares and associated coronal mass ejections are
sources of space weather that adversely impact devices at or near Earth,
including the obstruction of high-frequency radio waves utilized for
communication and the deterioration of power grid operations. Tracking and
delivering early and precise predictions of solar flares is essential for
readiness and catastrophe risk mitigation. This paper employs the random forest
(RF) model to address the binary classification task, analyzing the links
between solar flares and their originating ARs with observational data gathered
from 2011 to 2021 by SolarMonitor.org and the XRT flare database. We seek to
identify the physical features of a source AR that significantly influence its
potential to trigger >=C-class flares. We found that the features of
AR_Type_Today, Hale_Class_Yesterday are the most and the least prepotent
features, respectively. NoS_Difference has a remarkable effect in
decision-making in both global and local interpretations.</p></br>
