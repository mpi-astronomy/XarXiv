  Orbital Configurations Klassifier</h2></a>Authors:  Elio Thadhani, Yolanda Ba, Hanno Rein, Daniel Tamayo</br>Comments: 3 pages, 1 table. Submitted to RNAAS</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) package
collects machine learning models for predicting the stability and collisional
evolution of compact planetary systems. In this paper we explore improvements
to SPOCK's binary stability classifier (FeatureClassifier), which predicts
orbital stability by collecting data over a short N-body integration of a
system. We find that by using a system-specific timescale (rather than a fixed
$10^4$ orbits) for the integration, and by using this timescale as an
additional feature, we modestly improve the model's AUC metric from 0.943 to
0.950 (AUC=1 for a perfect model). We additionally discovered that $\approx
10\%$ of N-body integrations in SPOCK's original training dataset were
duplicated by accident, and that $<1\%$ were misclassified as stable when they
in fact led to ejections. We provide a cleaned dataset of 100,000+ unique
integrations, release a newly trained stability classification model, and make
minor updates to the API.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15149v1"><h2>Mapping Galaxy Images Across Ultraviolet, Visible and Infrared Bands
  Using Generative Deep Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Youssef Zaazou, Alex Bihlo, Terrence S. Tricco</br>Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures, Submitted to ApJ, GitHub:
  https://github.com/yazaazou/Galaxy-Band-Conversion</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, cs.AI</br><p>We demonstrate that generative deep learning can translate galaxy
observations across ultraviolet, visible, and infrared photometric bands.
Leveraging mock observations from the Illustris simulations, we develop and
validate a supervised image-to-image model capable of performing both band
interpolation and extrapolation. The resulting trained models exhibit high
fidelity in generating outputs, as verified by both general image comparison
metrics (MAE, SSIM, PSNR) and specialized astronomical metrics (GINI
coefficient, M20). Moreover, we show that our model can be used to predict
real-world observations, using data from the DECaLS survey as a case study.
These findings highlight the potential of generative learning to augment
astronomical datasets, enabling efficient exploration of multi-band information
in regions where observations are incomplete. This work opens new pathways for
optimizing mission planning, guiding high-resolution follow-ups, and enhancing
our understanding of galaxy morphology and evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15739v1"><h2>Automatic Machine Learning Framework to Study Morphological Parameters
  of AGN Host Galaxies within $z < 1.4$ in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide Survey</h2></a>Authors:  Chuan Tian, C. Megan Urry, Aritra Ghosh, Daisuke Nagai, Tonima T. Ananna, Meredith C. Powell, Connor Auge, Aayush Mishra, David B. Sanders, Nico Cappelluti, Kevin Schawinski</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal. 31 Pages. 20
  Figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We present a composite machine learning framework to estimate posterior
probability distributions of bulge-to-total light ratio, half-light radius, and
flux for Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within $z<1.4$ and $m<23$
in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide survey. We divide the data into five redshift
bins: low ($0<z<0.25$), mid ($0.25<z<0.5$), high ($0.5<z<0.9$), extra
($0.9<z<1.1$) and extreme ($1.1<z<1.4$), and train our models independently in
each bin. We use PSFGAN to decompose the AGN point source light from its host
galaxy, and invoke the Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN)
to estimate morphological parameters of the recovered host galaxy. We first
trained our models on simulated data, and then fine-tuned our algorithm via
transfer learning using labeled real data. To create training labels for
transfer learning, we used GALFIT to fit $\sim 20,000$ real HSC galaxies in
each redshift bin. We comprehensively examined that the predicted values from
our final models agree well with the GALFIT values for the vast majority of
cases. Our PSFGAN + GaMPEN framework runs at least three orders of magnitude
faster than traditional light-profile fitting methods, and can be easily
retrained for other morphological parameters or on other datasets with diverse
ranges of resolutions, seeing conditions, and signal-to-noise ratios, making it
an ideal tool for analyzing AGN host galaxies from large surveys coming soon
from the Rubin-LSST, Euclid, and Roman telescopes.</p></br>
