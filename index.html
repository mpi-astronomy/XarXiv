  asteroid hazards</h2></a>Authors:  Amit Kumar Mondal, Nafisha Aslam, Prasenjit Maji, Hemanta Kumar Mondal</br>Comments: 17 pages, 12 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>The potential for catastrophic collision makes near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) a
serious concern. Planetary defense depends on accurately classifying
potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), however the complexity of the data
hampers conventional techniques. This work offers a sophisticated method for
accurately predicting hazards by combining machine learning, deep learning,
explainable AI (XAI), and anomaly detection. Our approach extracts essential
parameters like size, velocity, and trajectory from historical and real-time
asteroid data. A hybrid algorithm improves prediction accuracy by combining
several cutting-edge models. A forecasting module predicts future asteroid
behavior, and Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the likelihood of collisions.
Timely mitigation is made possible by a real-time alarm system that notifies
worldwide monitoring stations. This technique enhances planetary defense
efforts by combining real-time alarms with sophisticated predictive modeling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16690v1"><h2>Making the unmodulated pyramid wavefront sensor smart II. First on-sky
  demonstration of extreme adaptive optics with deep learning</h2></a>Authors:  R. Landman, S. Y. Haffert, J. D. Long, J. R. Males, L. M. Close, W. B. Foster, K. Van Gorkom, O. Guyon, A. D. Hedglen, P. T. Johnson, M. Y. Kautz, J. K. Kueny, J. Li, J. Liberman, J. Lumbres, E. A. McEwen, A. McLeod, L. Schatz, E. Tonucci, K. Twitchell</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG, physics.optics</br><p>Pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFSs) are the preferred choice for current and
future extreme adaptive optics (XAO) systems. Almost all instruments use the
PWFS in its modulated form to mitigate its limited linearity range. However,
this modulation comes at the cost of a reduction in sensitivity, a blindness to
petal-piston modes, and a limit to the sensor's ability to operate at high
speeds. Therefore, there is strong interest to use the PWFS without modulation,
which can be enabled with nonlinear reconstructors. Here, we present the first
on-sky demonstration of XAO with an unmodulated PWFS using a nonlinear
reconstructor based on convolutional neural networks. We discuss the real-time
implementation on the Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (MagAO-X) instrument
using the optimized TensorRT framework and show that inference is fast enough
to run the control loop at >2 kHz frequencies. Our on-sky results demonstrate a
successful closed-loop operation using a model calibrated with internal source
data that delivers stable and robust correction under varying conditions.
Performance analysis reveals that our smart PWFS achieves nearly the same
Strehl ratio as the highly optimized modulated PWFS under favorable conditions
on bright stars. Notably, we observe an improvement in performance on a fainter
star under the influence of strong winds. These findings confirm the
feasibility of using the PWFS in its unmodulated form and highlight its
potential for next-generation instruments. Future efforts will focus on
achieving even higher control loop frequencies (>3 kHz), optimizing the
calibration procedures, and testing its performance on fainter stars, where
more gain is expected for the unmodulated PWFS compared to its modulated
counterpart.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16045v1"><h2>Open Science and Artificial Intelligence for supporting the
  sustainability of the SRC Network: The espSRC case</h2></a>Authors:  J. Garrido, S. Sánchez-Expósito, A. Ruiz-Falcó, J. Ruedas, M. Á. Mendoza, V. Vázquez, M. Parra, J. Sánchez, I. Labadie, L.

  XXXIV - 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>The SKA Observatory (SKAO), a landmark project in radio astronomy, seeks to
address fundamental questions in astronomy. To process its immense data output,
approximately 700 PB/year, a global network of SKA Regional Centres (SR-CNet)
will provide the infrastructure, tools, computational power needed for
scientific analysis and scientific support. The Spanish SRC (espSRC) focuses on
ensuring the sustainability of this network by reducing its environmental
impact, integrating green practices into data platforms, and developing Open
Science technologies to enable reproducible research. This paper discusses and
summarizes part of the research and development activities that the team is
conducting to reduce the SRC energy consumption at the espSRC and SRCNet. The
paper also discusses fundamental research on trusted repositories to support
Open Science practices.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15984v1"><h2>DIPLI: Deep Image Prior Lucky Imaging for Blind Astronomical Image
  Restoration</h2></a>Authors:  Suraj Singh, Anastasia Batsheva, Oleg Y. Rogov, Ahmed Bouridane</br>Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</br>Primary Category: cs.CV</br>All Categories: cs.CV, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, eess.IV</br><p>Contemporary image restoration and super-resolution techniques effectively
harness deep neural networks, markedly outperforming traditional methods.
However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to
limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep
Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to
overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images.
We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several
advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames
concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next,
we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin
dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with
minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these
modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss
function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated
our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects,
achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a
classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical
image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art
transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our
improvements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17117v1"><h2>A New Statistical Model of Star Speckles for Learning to Detect and
  Characterize Exoplanets in Direct Imaging Observations</h2></a>Authors:  Théo Bodrito, Olivier Flasseur, Julien Mairal, Jean Ponce, Maud Langlois, Anne-Marie Lagrange</br>Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2025</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.CV, cs.LG, stat.AP</br><p>The search for exoplanets is an active field in astronomy, with direct
imaging as one of the most challenging methods due to faint exoplanet signals
buried within stronger residual starlight. Successful detection requires
advanced image processing to separate the exoplanet signal from this nuisance
component. This paper presents a novel statistical model that captures nuisance
fluctuations using a multi-scale approach, leveraging problem symmetries and a
joint spectral channel representation grounded in physical principles. Our
model integrates into an interpretable, end-to-end learnable framework for
simultaneous exoplanet detection and flux estimation. The proposed algorithm is
evaluated against the state of the art using datasets from the SPHERE
instrument operating at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). It significantly
improves the precision-recall trade-off, notably on challenging datasets that
are otherwise unusable by astronomers. The proposed approach is computationally
efficient, robust to varying data quality, and well suited for large-scale
observational surveys.</p></br>
