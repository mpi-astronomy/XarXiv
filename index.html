  Networks for Photometric Redshift Estimation</h2></a>Authors:  Andrew Engel, Nell Byler, Adam Tsou, Gautham Narayan, Emmanuel Bonilla, Ian Smith</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>We present Mantis Shrimp, a multi-survey deep learning model for photometric
redshift estimation that fuses ultra-violet (GALEX), optical (PanSTARRS), and
infrared (UnWISE) imagery. Machine learning is now an established approach for
photometric redshift estimation, with generally acknowledged higher performance
in areas with a high density of spectroscopically identified galaxies over
template-based methods. Multiple works have shown that image-based
convolutional neural networks can outperform tabular-based color/magnitude
models. In comparison to tabular models, image models have additional design
complexities: it is largely unknown how to fuse inputs from different
instruments which have different resolutions or noise properties. The Mantis
Shrimp model estimates the conditional density estimate of redshift using
cutout images. The density estimates are well calibrated and the point
estimates perform well in the distribution of available spectroscopically
confirmed galaxies with (bias = 1e-2), scatter (NMAD = 2.44e-2) and
catastrophic outlier rate ($\eta$=17.53$\%$). We find that early fusion
approaches (e.g., resampling and stacking images from different instruments)
match the performance of late fusion approaches (e.g., concatenating latent
space representations), so that the design choice ultimately is left to the
user. Finally, we study how the models learn to use information across bands,
finding evidence that our models successfully incorporates information from all
surveys. The applicability of our model to the analysis of large populations of
galaxies is limited by the speed of downloading cutouts from external servers;
however, our model could be useful in smaller studies such as generating priors
over redshift for stellar population synthesis.</p></br>
