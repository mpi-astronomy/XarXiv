H_r < 8.2$ detected in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we characterize the
relationships between their dynamical state and physical properties -- namely
$H_r$, indicating size; colors, indicating surface composition; and flux
variation semi-amplitude $A$, indicating asphericity and surface inhomogeneity.
We seek ``birth'' physical distributions that can recreate these parameters in
every dynamical class. We show that the observed colors of these TNOs are
consistent with 2 Gaussian distributions in $griz$ space, ``near-IR bright''
(NIRB) and ``near-IR faint'' (NIRF), presumably an inner and outer birth
population, respectively. We find a model in which both the NIRB and NIRF $H_r$
and $A$ distributions are independent of current dynamical states, supporting
their assignment as birth populations. All objects are consistent with a common
rolling $p(H_r)$, but NIRF objects are significantly more variable. Cold
classicals (CCs) are purely NIRF, while hot classical (HC), scattered, and
detached TNOs are consistent with $\approx70\%$ NIRB, and resonances' NIRB
fractions show significant variation. The NIRB component of the HCs and of some
resonances have broader inclination distributions than the NIRFs, i.e. their
current dynamics retains information about birth location. We find evidence for
radial stratification within the birth NIRB population, in that HC NIRBs are on
average redder than detached or scattered NIRBs; a similar effect distinguishes
CCs from other NIRFs. We estimate total object counts and masses of each class
within our $H_r$ range. These results will strongly constrain models of the
outer solar system.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03921v1"><h2>Cosmological Parameter Estimation with Sequential Linear
  Simulation-based Inference</h2></a>Authors:  Nicolas Mediato-Diaz, Will Handley</br>Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an, stat.ML</br><p>We develop the framework of Linear Simulation-based Inference (LSBI), an
application of simulation-based inference where the likelihood is approximated
by a Gaussian linear function of its parameters. We obtain analytical
expressions for the posterior distributions of hyper-parameters of the linear
likelihood in terms of samples drawn from a simulator, for both uniform and
conjugate priors. This method is applied sequentially to several toy-models and
tested on emulated datasets for the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature
power spectrum. We find that convergence is achieved after four or five rounds
of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ simulations, which is competitive with state-of-the-art
neural density estimation methods. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is
possible to obtain significant information gain and generate posteriors that
agree with the underlying parameters while maintaining explainability and
intellectual oversight.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02311v1"><h2>Analysis of Fluorescence Telescope Data Using Machine Learning Methods</h2></a>Authors:  Mikhail Zotov, Pavel Zakharov</br>Comments: 12 pages; to be published in the proceedings of the 38th Russian
  Cosmic Ray Conference (2024)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Fluorescence telescopes are among the key instruments used for studying
ultra-high energy cosmic rays in all modern experiments. We use model data for
a small ground-based telescope EUSO-TA to try some methods of machine learning
and neural networks for recognizing tracks of extensive air showers in its data
and for reconstruction of energy and arrival directions of primary particles.
We also comment on the opportunities to use this approach for other
fluorescence telescopes and outline possible ways of improving the performance
of the suggested methods.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02473v1"><h2>IRIS: A Bayesian Approach for Image Reconstruction in Radio
  Interferometry with expressive Score-Based priors</h2></a>Authors:  Noé Dia, M. J. Yantovski-Barth, Alexandre Adam, Micah Bowles, Laurence Perreault-Levasseur, Yashar Hezaveh, Anna Scaife</br>Comments: 17 pages, 8 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, eess.IV</br><p>Inferring sky surface brightness distributions from noisy interferometric
data in a principled statistical framework has been a key challenge in radio
astronomy. In this work, we introduce Imaging for Radio Interferometry with
Score-based models (IRIS). We use score-based models trained on optical images
of galaxies as an expressive prior in combination with a Gaussian likelihood in
the uv-space to infer images of protoplanetary disks from visibility data of
the DSHARP survey conducted by ALMA. We demonstrate the advantages of this
framework compared with traditional radio interferometry imaging algorithms,
showing that it produces plausible posterior samples despite the use of a
misspecified galaxy prior. Through coverage testing on simulations, we
empirically evaluate the accuracy of this approach to generate calibrated
posterior samples.</p></br>
