  Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Oisín Creaner, Anna Preis, Cormac Ryan, Nika Gorchakova</br>Comments: Author's manuscript version of paper accepted for publication in
  Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union, published by Cambridge
  University Press. Presented at Kavli-IAU Symposium 2024 "(Toward) Discovery
  of life beyond Earth and its impact". 5 pages, 2 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>We present the progress of work to streamline and simplify the process of
exoplanet observation by citizen scientists. International collaborations such
as ExoClock and Exoplanet Watch enable citizen scientists to use small
telescopes to carry out transit observations. These studies provide essential
supports for space missions such as JWST and ARIEL. Contributions include
maintenance or recovery of ephemerides, follow up confirmation and transit time
variations. Ongoing observation programs benefit from a large pool of
observers, with a wide variety of experience levels. Our projects work closely
with these communities to streamline their observation pipelines and enable
wider participation. Two complementary approaches are taken: Star Guide applies
human-centric design and community consultation to identify points of friction
within existing systems and provide complementary online tools and resources to
reduce barriers to entry to the observing community. Machine Learning is used
to accelerate data processing and automate steps which are currently manual,
providing a streamlined tool for citizen science and a scalable solution for
large-scale archival research.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15901v1"><h2>A multi-model approach using XAI and anomaly detection to predict
  asteroid hazards</h2></a>Authors:  Amit Kumar Mondal, Nafisha Aslam, Prasenjit Maji, Hemanta Kumar Mondal</br>Comments: 17 pages, 12 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>The potential for catastrophic collision makes near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) a
serious concern. Planetary defense depends on accurately classifying
potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), however the complexity of the data
hampers conventional techniques. This work offers a sophisticated method for
accurately predicting hazards by combining machine learning, deep learning,
explainable AI (XAI), and anomaly detection. Our approach extracts essential
parameters like size, velocity, and trajectory from historical and real-time
asteroid data. A hybrid algorithm improves prediction accuracy by combining
several cutting-edge models. A forecasting module predicts future asteroid
behavior, and Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the likelihood of collisions.
Timely mitigation is made possible by a real-time alarm system that notifies
worldwide monitoring stations. This technique enhances planetary defense
efforts by combining real-time alarms with sophisticated predictive modeling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14192v1"><h2>Strategic White Paper on AI Infrastructure for Particle, Nuclear, and
  Astroparticle Physics: Insights from JENA and EuCAIF</h2></a>Authors:  Sascha Caron, Andreas Ipp, Gert Aarts, Gábor Bíró, Daniele Bonacorsi, Elena Cuoco, Caterina Doglioni, Tommaso Dorigo, Julián García Pardiñas, Stefano Giagu, Tobias Golling, Lukas Heinrich, Ik Siong Heng, Paula Gina Isar, Karolos Potamianos, Liliana Teodorescu, John Veitch, Pietro Vischia, Christoph Weniger</br>Comments: 19 pages, 5 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, cs.AI, cs.LG, hep-ex, hep-ph, nucl-th</br><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming scientific research, with deep
learning methods playing a central role in data analysis, simulations, and
signal detection across particle, nuclear, and astroparticle physics. Within
the JENA communities-ECFA, NuPECC, and APPEC-and as part of the EuCAIF
initiative, AI integration is advancing steadily. However, broader adoption
remains constrained by challenges such as limited computational resources, a
lack of expertise, and difficulties in transitioning from research and
development (R&D) to production. This white paper provides a strategic roadmap,
informed by a community survey, to address these barriers. It outlines critical
infrastructure requirements, prioritizes training initiatives, and proposes
funding strategies to scale AI capabilities across fundamental physics over the
next five years.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16045v1"><h2>Open Science and Artificial Intelligence for supporting the
  sustainability of the SRC Network: The espSRC case</h2></a>Authors:  J. Garrido, S. Sánchez-Expósito, A. Ruiz-Falcó, J. Ruedas, M. Á. Mendoza, V. Vázquez, M. Parra, J. Sánchez, I. Labadie, L. Darriba, J. Moldón, M. Rodriguez-Álvarez, J. Díaz, L. Verdes-Montenegro</br>Comments: Conference: Astronomical Data Analysis Software & Systems - ADASS
  XXXIV - 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>The SKA Observatory (SKAO), a landmark project in radio astronomy, seeks to
address fundamental questions in astronomy. To process its immense data output,
approximately 700 PB/year, a global network of SKA Regional Centres (SR-CNet)
will provide the infrastructure, tools, computational power needed for
scientific analysis and scientific support. The Spanish SRC (espSRC) focuses on
ensuring the sustainability of this network by reducing its environmental
impact, integrating green practices into data platforms, and developing Open
Science technologies to enable reproducible research. This paper discusses and
summarizes part of the research and development activities that the team is
conducting to reduce the SRC energy consumption at the espSRC and SRCNet. The
paper also discusses fundamental research on trusted repositories to support
Open Science practices.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15984v1"><h2>DIPLI: Deep Image Prior Lucky Imaging for Blind Astronomical Image
  Restoration</h2></a>Authors:  Suraj Singh, Anastasia Batsheva, Oleg Y. Rogov, Ahmed Bouridane</br>Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</br>Primary Category: cs.CV</br>All Categories: cs.CV, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, eess.IV</br><p>Contemporary image restoration and super-resolution techniques effectively
harness deep neural networks, markedly outperforming traditional methods.
However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to
limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep
Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to
overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images.
We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several
advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames
concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next,
we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin
dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with
minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these
modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss
function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated
our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects,
achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a
classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical
image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art
transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our
improvements.</p></br>
