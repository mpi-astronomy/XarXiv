cosmological/astronomical data analysis and machine learning research
workflows. This implements a complete pipeline from idea generation to
experimental evaluation and research dissemination, mimicking the scientific
process typically performed by human researchers. The system employs
specialized agents for planning, coding, execution, analysis, and synthesis
that work together to develop novel approaches. Unlike traditional auto
machine-learning systems, the AI Cosmologist generates diverse implementation
strategies, writes complete code, handles execution errors, analyzes results,
and synthesizes new approaches based on experimental outcomes. We demonstrate
the AI Cosmologist capabilities across several machine learning tasks, showing
how it can successfully explore solution spaces, iterate based on experimental
results, and combine successful elements from different approaches. Our results
indicate that agentic systems can automate portions of the research process,
potentially accelerating scientific discovery. The code and experimental data
used in this paper are available on GitHub at
https://github.com/adammoss/aicosmologist. Example papers included in the
appendix demonstrate the system's capability to autonomously produce complete
scientific publications, starting from only the dataset and task description</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.04455v1"><h2>EclipseNETs: Learning Irregular Small Celestial Body Silhouettes</h2></a>Authors:  Giacomo Acciarini, Dario Izzo, Francesco Biscani</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>Accurately predicting eclipse events around irregular small bodies is crucial
for spacecraft navigation, orbit determination, and spacecraft systems
management. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging neural implicit
representations to model eclipse conditions efficiently and reliably. We
propose neural network architectures that capture the complex silhouettes of
asteroids and comets with high precision. Tested on four well-characterized
bodies - Bennu, Itokawa, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and Eros - our method
achieves accuracy comparable to traditional ray-tracing techniques while
offering orders of magnitude faster performance. Additionally, we develop an
indirect learning framework that trains these models directly from sparse
trajectory data using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, removing the
requirement to have prior knowledge of an accurate shape model. This approach
allows for the continuous refinement of eclipse predictions, progressively
reducing errors and improving accuracy as new trajectory data is incorporated.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05235v1"><h2>IAEmu: Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations</h2></a>Authors:  Sneh Pandya, Yuanyuan Yang, Nicholas Van Alfen, Jonathan Blazek, Robin Walters</br>Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing
analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions
and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust
cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods
that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce
IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy
position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and
orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties
using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework.
Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for
$\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The
emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify
regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate
generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG
hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu
enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation
functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration
facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a
powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct
applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02196v1"><h2>Orbit Determination through Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</h2></a>Authors:  Pedro K de Albuquerque, Andre R Kuroswiski, Annie S. Wu, Willer G. dos Santos, Paulo Costa</br>Comments: This paper was presented at the 2024 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics
  Specialist Conference, August 11-15, 2024, Broomfield, Colorado, USA</br>Primary Category: physics.ins-det</br>All Categories: physics.ins-det, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>This research explores the use of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation
as a reference signal for Initial Orbit Determination (IOD). By leveraging the
unique properties of CMB, this study introduces a novel method for estimating
spacecraft velocity and position with minimal reliance on pre-existing
environmental data, offering significant advantages for space missions
independent of Earth-specific conditions. Using Machine Learning (ML)
regression models, this approach demonstrates the capability to determine
velocity from CMB signals and subsequently determine the satellite's position.
The results indicate that CMB has the potential to enhance the autonomy and
flexibility of spacecraft operations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03283v1"><h2>Effect of Nonlinear Surface Inflows into Activity Belts on Solar Cycle
  Modulation</h2></a>Authors:  Mohammed H. Talafha, Krist√≥f Petrovay, Andrea Opitz</br>Comments: 21 pages, 10 figures, Solar Physics Journal, Accepted: 04 April 2025</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>Converging flows are visible around bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) on the
solar surface, according to observations. Average flows are created by these
inflows combined, and the strength of these flows depends on the amount of flux
present during the solar cycle. In models of the solar cycle, this average flow
can be depicted as perturbations to the meridional flow. In this article, we
study the effects of introducing surface inflow to the surface flux transport
models (SFT) as a possible nonlinear mechanism in the presence of latitude
quenching for an inflow profile whose amplitude varies within a cycle depending
on the magnetic activity. The results show that including surface inflows in
the model in the presence of both LQ and tilt quenching (TQ) produced a polar
field within a $\pm$1$\sigma$ of an average cycle polar field ($\sigma$ is the
standard deviation) and a correlation coefficient of 0.85. We confirm that
including inflows produces a lower net contribution to the dipole moment
(10\,--\,25\%). Furthermore, the relative importance of LQ vs. inflows is
inversely correlated with the dynamo effectivity range ($\lambda_{R}$). With no
decay term, introducing inflows into the model resulted in a less significant
net contribution to the dipole moment. Including inflows in the SFT model shows
a possible nonlinear relationship between the surface inflows and the solar
dipole moment, suggesting a potential nonlinear mechanism contributing to the
saturation of the global dynamo. For lower $\lambda_R$ ($\lessapprox$ 10
$^\circ$), TQ always dominates LQ, and for higher $\lambda_R$ LQ dominate.
However, including inflows will make the domination a little bit earlier in
case of having a decay term in the model.</p></br>
