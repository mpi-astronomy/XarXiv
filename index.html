around exoplanets, offering insights into the possible existence of satellites
and ring systems. This study aims to utilize Machine Learning (ML) techniques
to generate predictive maps of stable regions surrounding a hypothetical
planet. The approach can also be extended to planet-satellite systems,
planetary ring systems, and other similar configurations. A dataset was
generated using 10^5 numerical simulations, each incorporating nine orbital
features for the planet and a test particle in a star-planet-test particle
system. The simulations were classified as stable or unstable based on
stability criteria, requiring particles to remain stable over a timespan
equivalent to 10,000 orbital periods of the planet. Various ML algorithms were
tested and fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization to determine the most
effective predictive model. Tree-based algorithms showed comparable accuracy in
performance. The best-performing model, using the Extreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) algorithm, achieved an accuracy of 98.48%, with 94% recall and
precision for stable particles and 99% for unstable particles. ML algorithms
significantly reduce the computational time required for three-body
simulations, operating approximately 100,000 times faster than traditional
numerical methods. Predictive models can generate entire stability maps in less
than a second, compared to the days required by numerical simulations. The
results from the trained ML models will be made accessible through a public web
interface, enabling broader scientific applications.</p></br>
