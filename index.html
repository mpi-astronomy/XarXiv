Wijnholds, George Azzopardi</br>Comments: 5 pages, URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference and URSI Radio
  Science Letters (RSL)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Detecting anomalies in radio astronomy is challenging due to the vast amounts
of data and the rarity of labeled anomalous examples. Addressing this challenge
requires efficient methods capable of identifying unusual radio galaxy
morphologies without relying on extensive supervision. This work introduces an
innovative approach to anomaly detection based on morphological characteristics
of the radio sources using trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter
Responses) filters as an efficient alternative to complex deep learning
methods. The framework integrates COSFIRE descriptors with an unsupervised
Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to identify unusual radio galaxy
morphologies. Evaluations on a radio galaxy benchmark data set demonstrate
strong performance, with the COSFIRE-based approach achieving a geometric mean
(G-Mean) score of 79%, surpassing the 77% achieved by a computationally
intensive deep learning autoencoder. By characterizing normal patterns and
detecting deviations, this semi-supervised methodology overcomes the need for
anomalous examples in the training set, a major limitation of traditional
supervised methods. This approach shows promise for next-generation radio
telescopes, where fast processing and the ability to discover unknown phenomena
are crucial.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19896v1"><h2>Large Language Models as Autonomous Spacecraft Operators in Kerbal Space
  Program</h2></a>Authors:  Alejandro Carrasco, Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez, Richard Linares</br>Comments: Non revised version for paper going to be published in Journal of
  Advances in Space Research</br>Primary Category: cs.AI</br>All Categories: cs.AI, astro-ph.IM, cs.CL</br><p>Recent trends are emerging in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
autonomous agents that take actions based on the content of the user text
prompts. We intend to apply these concepts to the field of Control in space,
enabling LLMs to play a significant role in the decision-making process for
autonomous satellite operations. As a first step towards this goal, we have
developed a pure LLM-based solution for the Kerbal Space Program Differential
Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software design competition where
participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering satellites involved in
non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP game engine. Our approach
leverages prompt engineering, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning techniques to
create an effective LLM-based agent that ranked 2nd in the competition. To the
best of our knowledge, this work pioneers the integration of LLM agents into
space research. The project comprises several open repositories to facilitate
replication and further research. The codebase is accessible on
\href{https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/kspdg}{GitHub}, while the trained models
and datasets are available on \href{https://huggingface.co/OhhTuRnz}{Hugging

  Fuel Heating and Prospects for Delayed-Detonations</h2></a>Authors:  Ezra Brooker, Andrey Zhiglo, Tomasz Plewa</br>Comments: 17 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, physics.data-an</br><p>The aim of this work is to characterize the thermodynamic state of fuel mixed
into the turbulent flame brush in the context of the Zel'dovich
deflagration-to-detonation transition (ZDDT) mechanism of Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia). We perform a series of three-dimensional computer simulations of
thermonuclear deflagrations subject to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI)
for conditions found in model explosions of centrally ignited realistic,
Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf progenitors. These conditions correspond to
explosion times when the flame reaches low density progenitor regions where DDT
is expected to occur. The flame database is constructed using a thickened flame
model. High numerical resolution is achieved with the help of the adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) approach allowing, for the first time, to resolve mesoscale
buoyancy-driven flame turbulence. The system is evolved to a quasi-steady
state, and flow properties in the turbulent region, where turbulence is most
isotropic, is analyzed in a co-moving frame of reference. We find evidence for
strong buoyancy-driven adiabatic heating of fuel layers adjacent to the flame
front. The heating results in a dramatic reduction of fuel ignition times by
between $\approx$2 and more than about 5 orders of magnitude. The heating
increases with the RTI forcing. The observed shortening of fuel burning
timescales suggests a new source of energy is important inside fuel penetrating
the flame brush. These regions are up to several hundred meters wide. On the
basis of the previous results of turbulent combustion in SNe Ia,
preconditioning required by the ZDDT mechanism can occur there.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20947v1"><h2>Unified Deep Learning Approach for Estimating the Metallicities of RR
  Lyrae Stars Using light curves from Gaia Data Release 3</h2></a>Authors:  Lorenzo Monti, Tatiana Muraveva, Alessia Garofalo, Gisella Clementini, Maria Letizia Valentini</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.AI</br><p>RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are old pulsating variables widely used as metallicity
tracers due to the correlation between their metal abundances and light curve
morphology. With ESA Gaia DR3 providing light curves for about 270,000 RRLs,
there is a pressing need for scalable methods to estimate their metallicities
from photometric data. We introduce a unified deep learning framework that
estimates metallicities for both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone
(RRc) RRLs using Gaia G-band light curves. This approach extends our previous
work on RRab stars to include RRc stars, aiming for high predictive accuracy
and broad generalization across both pulsation types. The model is based on a
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network optimized for time-series extrinsic
regression. Our pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as phase folding,
smoothing, and sample weighting, and uses photometric metallicities from the
literature as training targets. The architecture is designed to handle
morphological differences between RRab and RRc light curves without requiring
separate models. On held-out validation sets, our GRU model achieves strong
performance: for RRab stars, MAE = 0.0565 dex, RMSE = 0.0765 dex, R^2 = 0.9401;
for RRc stars, MAE = 0.0505 dex, RMSE = 0.0720 dex, R^2 = 0.9625. These results
show the effectiveness of deep learning for large-scale photometric metallicity
estimation and support its application to studies of stellar populations and
Galactic structure.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21215v1"><h2>Transfer learning for multifidelity simulation-based inference in
  cosmology</h2></a>Authors:  Alex A. Saoulis, Davide Piras, Niall Jeffrey, Alessio Spurio Mancini, Ana M. G. Ferreira, Benjamin Joachimi</br>Comments: 9+4 pages, 8+5 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><p>Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables cosmological parameter estimation
when closed-form likelihoods or models are unavailable. However, SBI relies on
machine learning for neural compression and density estimation. This requires
large training datasets which are prohibitively expensive for high-quality
simulations. We overcome this limitation with multifidelity transfer learning,
combining less expensive, lower-fidelity simulations with a limited number of
high-fidelity simulations. We demonstrate our methodology on dark matter
density maps from two separate simulation suites in the hydrodynamical CAMELS
Multifield Dataset. Pre-training on dark-matter-only $N$-body simulations
reduces the required number of high-fidelity hydrodynamical simulations by a
factor between $8$ and $15$, depending on the model complexity, posterior
dimensionality, and performance metrics used. By leveraging cheaper
simulations, our approach enables performant and accurate inference on
high-fidelity models while substantially reducing computational costs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21220v1"><h2>Wavelet Flow For Extragalactic Foreground Simulations</h2></a>Authors:  M. Mebratu, W. L. K. Wu</br>Comments: 19 pages, 7 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><p>Extragalactic foregrounds in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations
are both a source of cosmological and astrophysical information and a nuisance
to the CMB. Effective field-level modeling that captures their non-Gaussian
statistical distributions is increasingly important for optimal information
extraction, particularly given the precise and low-noise observations from
current and upcoming experiments. We explore the use of Wavelet Flow (WF)
models to tackle the novel task of modeling the field-level probability
distributions of multi-component CMB secondaries. Specifically, we jointly
train correlated CMB lensing convergence ($\kappa$) and cosmic infrared
background (CIB) maps with a WF model and obtain a network that statistically
recovers the input to high accuracy -- the trained network generates samples of
$\kappa$ and CIB fields whose average power spectra are within a few percent of
the inputs across all scales, and whose Minkowski functionals are similarly
accurate compared to the inputs. Leveraging the multiscale architecture of
these models, we fine-tune both the model parameters and the priors at each
scale independently, optimizing performance across different resolutions. These
results demonstrate that WF models can accurately simulate correlated
components of CMB secondaries, supporting improved analysis of cosmological
data. Our code and trained models can be found here

  and DES-SN5YR Observations: Hints For New Expansion Rate Anomalies</h2></a>Authors:  Purba Mukherjee, Anjan A Sen</br>Comments: 21 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables. Comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, gr-qc</br><p>In this work, we perform a model-agnostic reconstruction of the cosmic
expansion history by combining DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR data, with a focus on
geometric determination of characteristic redshifts where notable tensions in
the expansion rate are found to emerge. Employing Gaussian process regression
alongside knot-based spline techniques, we reconstruct cosmic distances and
their derivatives to pinpoint these characteristic redshifts and infer $E(z)$.
Our analysis reveals significant deviations of approximately 4 to 5$\sigma$
from the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM predictions, particularly pronounced in the
redshift range $z \sim 0.35-0.55$. These anomalies are consistently observed
across both reconstruction methods and combined datasets, indicating robust
late-time departures that could signal new physics beyond the standard
cosmological framework. The joint use of BAO and SN probes enhances the
precision of our constraints, allowing us to isolate these deviations without
reliance on specific cosmological assumptions. Our findings underscore the role
of characteristic redshifts as sensitive indicators of expansion rate anomalies
and motivate further scrutiny with forthcoming datasets from DESI-5YR BAO,
Euclid, and LSST. These future surveys will tighten constraints and help
distinguish whether these late-time anomalies arise from new fundamental
physics or unresolved systematics in the data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21667v1"><h2>Prospect of Constraining the EoS of Neutron Stars Using Post-Merger
  Signals</h2></a>Authors:  Soham Mitra, Praveer Tiwari, Archana Pai</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.HE</br>All Categories: astro-ph.HE, gr-qc, hep-ph, nucl-th, physics.data-an</br><p>Post-merger gravitational-wave emission from a binary neutron star merger
carries crucial information about the equation of state (EoS) of matter at high
temperatures. Current gravitational wave detectors have limited sensitivities
at post-merger frequencies in the range [1.5, 4] kHz. Therefore, valuable
inferences can only be made after combining information from multiple (BNS)
events. Criswell et al. [Phys. Rev. D 107, 043021 (2023)] carries out an
injection study to infer the radius posterior for a $1.6 M_{\odot}$ NS by
combining the information from injected BNS events via the hierarchical
Bayesian inference (HBI) formulation. This formulation utilizes empirical
relations that connect the peak frequency of the post-merger remnant with the
chirp mass of the system, and the EoS proxy parameter $R_{1.6}$. In this work,
we extend the HBI formulation to other EoS proxy parameters (i.e., the radius
of (NS), $R_{1.X}$, with masses 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8 $M_{\odot}$) and combine the
four $R_{1.X}$ posteriors through the piecewise polytropic EoS model to obtain
measurable constraints on the EoS of the NS. We show that the NS radii can be
constrained to within $\sim$1 km ( $\sim$0.55 km) assuming uniform
(astrophysical) prior on $R_{1.X}$ for injections in the A+ noise. We also
study systematic biases in the analysis coming from the limitations of
empirical relations.</p></br>
