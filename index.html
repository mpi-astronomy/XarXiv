  for robust characterization of geomagnetic indices at mid-latitude</h2></a>Authors:  Rungployphan Kieokaew, Veronika Haberle, Aurélie Marchaudon, Pierre-Louis Blelly, Aude Chambodut</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: physics.space-ph</br>All Categories: physics.space-ph, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG, physics.geo-ph</br><p>Geomagnetic indices derived from ground magnetic measurements characterize
the intensity of solar-terrestrial interaction. The \textit{Kp} index derived
from multiple magnetic observatories at mid-latitude has commonly been used for
space weather operations. Yet, its temporal cadence is low and its intensity
scale is crude. To derive a new generation of geomagnetic indices, it is
desirable to establish a geomagnetic `baseline' that defines the quiet-level of
activity without solar-driven perturbations. We present a new approach for
deriving a baseline that represents the time-dependent quiet variations
focusing on data from Chambon-la-For\^et, France. Using a filtering technique,
the measurements are first decomposed into the above-diurnal variation and the
sum of 24h, 12h, 8h, and 6h filters, called the daily variation. Using
correlation tools and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we identify parameters
that dominantly correlate with the daily variation. Here, we predict the daily
`quiet' variation using a long short-term memory neural network trained using
at least 11 years of data at 1h cadence. This predicted daily quiet variation
is combined with linear extrapolation of the secular trend associated with the
intrinsic geomagnetic variability, which dominates the above-diurnal variation,
to yield a new geomagnetic baseline. Unlike the existing baselines, our
baseline is insensitive to geomagnetic storms. It is thus suitable for defining
geomagnetic indices that accurately reflect the intensity of solar-driven
perturbations. Our methodology is quick to implement and scalable, making it
suitable for real-time operation. Strategies for operational forecasting of our
geomagnetic baseline 1 day and 27 days in advance are presented.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02704v1"><h2>Analyzing black-hole ringdowns II: data conditioning</h2></a>Authors:  Harrison Siegel, Maximiliano Isi, Will M. Farr</br>Comments: Data Release:
  https://github.com/HarrisonS-Phys/ringdown-data-conditioning</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Time series data from observations of black hole ringdown gravitational waves
are often analyzed in the time domain by using damped sinusoid models with
acyclic boundary conditions. Data conditioning operations, including
downsampling, filtering, and the choice of data segment duration, reduce the
computational cost of such analyses and can improve numerical stability. Here
we analyze simulated damped sinsuoid signals to illustrate how data
conditioning operations, if not carefully applied, can undesirably alter the
analysis' posterior distributions. We discuss how currently implemented
downsampling and filtering methods, if applied too aggressively, can introduce
systematic errors and skew tests of general relativity. These issues arise
because current downsampling and filtering methods do not operate identically
on the data and model. Alternative downsampling and filtering methods which
identically operate on the data and model may be achievable, but we argue that
the current operations can still be implemented safely. We also show that our
preferred anti-alias filtering technique, which has an instantaneous
frequency-domain response at its roll-off frequency, preserves the structure of
posterior distributions better than other commonly used filters with transient
frequency-domain responses. Lastly, we highlight that exceptionally long data
segments may need to be analyzed in cases where thin lines in the noise power
spectral density overlap with central signal frequencies. Our findings may be
broadly applicable to any analysis of truncated time domain data with acyclic
boundary conditions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01751v1"><h2>Impact of Redshift Space Distortion on Persistent Homology of cosmic
  matter density field</h2></a>Authors:  Fatemeh Abedi, Mohammad Hossein Jalali Kanafi, S. M. S. Movahed</br>Comments: 16 pages, 9 figures and 1 table</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an</br><p>By employing summary statistics obtained from Persistent Homology (PH), we
investigate the influence of Redshift Space Distortion (RSD) on the topology of
excursion sets formed through the super-level filtration method applied to
three-dimensional matter density fields. The synthetic fields simulated by the
Quijote suite in both real and redshift spaces are smoothed by accounting for
the Gaussian smoothing function with different scales. The RSD leads a tendency
for clusters ($\tilde{\beta}_0$) to shift towards higher thresholds, while
filament loops ($\tilde{\beta}_1$) and cosmic voids ($\tilde{\beta}_2$) migrate
towards lower thresholds. Notably, $\tilde{\beta}_2$ exhibits greater
sensitivity to RSD compared to clusters and independent loops. As the smoothing
scales increase, the amplitude of the reduced Betti number curve
($\tilde{\beta}_k$) decreases, and the corresponding peak position shifts
towards the mean threshold. Conversely, the amplitude of $\tilde{\beta}_k$
remains almost unchanged with variations in redshift for $z\in[0-3]$. The
analysis of persistent entropy and the overall abundance of $k$-holes indicates
that the linear Kaiser effect plays a significant role compared to the
non-linear effect for $R \gtrsim 30$ Mpc $h^{-1}$ at $z=0$, whereas persistent
entropy proves to be a reliable measure against non-linear influences.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02857v1"><h2>Reconstructing Galaxy Cluster Mass Maps using Score-based Generative
  Modeling</h2></a>Authors:  Alan Hsu, Matthew Ho, Joyce Lin, Carleen Markey, Michelle Ntampaka, Hy Trac, Barnabás Póczos</br>Comments: 15 pages, 9 figures, submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><p>We present a novel approach to reconstruct gas and dark matter projected
density maps of galaxy clusters using score-based generative modeling. Our
diffusion model takes in mock SZ and X-ray images as conditional observations,
and generates realizations of corresponding gas and dark matter maps by
sampling from a learned data posterior. We train and validate the performance
of our model by using mock data from a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation.
The model accurately reconstructs both the mean and spread of the radial
density profiles in the spatial domain to within 5\%, indicating that the model
is able to distinguish between clusters of different sizes. In the spectral
domain, the model achieves close-to-unity values for the bias and
cross-correlation coefficients, indicating that the model can accurately probe
cluster structures on both large and small scales. Our experiments demonstrate
the ability of score models to learn a strong, nonlinear, and unbiased mapping
between input observables and fundamental density distributions of galaxy
clusters. These diffusion models can be further fine-tuned and generalized to
not only take in additional observables as inputs, but also real observations
and predict unknown density distributions of galaxy clusters.</p></br>
