  Generative Adversarial Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Yu. Yu. Dubenskaya, A. P. Kryukov, E. O. Gres, S. P. Polyakov, E. B. Postnikov, P. A. Volchugov, A. A. Vlaskina, D. P. Zhurov</br>Comments: 19 pages, 10 figures, Proceedings of The 8th International Conference

amount of data that must be classified automatically, ideally in real time.
Currently, machine learning-based solutions are increasingly being used to
solve classification problems. However, these classifiers require proper
training data sets to work correctly. The problem with training neural networks
on real IACT data is that these data need to be pre-labeled, whereas such
labeling is difficult and its results are estimates. In addition, the
distribution of incoming events is highly imbalanced. Firstly, there is an
imbalance in the types of events, since the number of detected gamma quanta is
significantly less than the number of protons. Secondly, the energy
distribution of particles of the same type is also imbalanced, since
high-energy particles are extremely rare. This imbalance results in poorly
trained classifiers that, once trained, do not handle rare events correctly.
Using only conventional Monte Carlo event simulation methods to solve this
problem is possible, but extremely resource-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose to perform data augmentation with artificially
generated events of the desired type and energy using conditional generative
adversarial networks (cGANs), distinguishing classes by energy values. In the
paper, we describe a simple algorithm for generating balanced data sets using
cGANs. Thus, the proposed neural network model produces both imbalanced data
sets for physical analysis as well as balanced data sets suitable for training
other neural networks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03959v1"><h2>Improving the Temporal Resolution of SOHO/MDI Magnetograms of Solar
  Active Regions Using a Deep Generative Model</h2></a>Authors:  Jialiang Li, Vasyl Yurchyshyn, Jason T. L. Wang, Haimin Wang, Yasser Abduallah, Khalid A. Alobaid, Chunhui Xu, Ruizhu Chen, Yan Xu</br>Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We present a novel deep generative model, named GenMDI, to improve the
temporal resolution of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of solar active regions
(ARs) collected by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Unlike previous studies that focus primarily
on spatial super-resolution of MDI magnetograms, our approach can perform
temporal super-resolution, which generates and inserts synthetic data between
observed MDI magnetograms, thus providing finer temporal structure and enhanced
details in the LOS data. The GenMDI model employs a conditional diffusion
process, which synthesizes images by considering both preceding and subsequent
magnetograms, ensuring that the generated images are not only of high-quality,
but also temporally coherent with the surrounding data. Experimental results
show that the GenMDI model performs better than the traditional linear
interpolation method, especially in ARs with dynamic evolution in magnetic
fields.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04227v1"><h2>Potential of Ka-band Range Rate Post-fit Residuals for High-frequency
  Mass Change Applications</h2></a>Authors:  Michal Cuadrat-Grzybowski, Joao G. Teixeira da Encarnacao, Pieter N. A. M. Visser</br>Comments: To be later submitted to JGR: Solid Earth (AGU) later in March 2025</br>Primary Category: physics.geo-ph</br>All Categories: physics.geo-ph, astro-ph.EP, physics.ao-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>We present the first extensive analysis of K/Ka-band ranging post-fit
residuals of an official Level-2 product, characterised as Line-of-Sight
Gravity Differences (LGD), which exhibit and showcase interesting sub-monthly
geophysical signals. These residuals, provided by CSR, were derived from the
difference between spherical harmonic coefficient least-squares fits and
reduced Level-1B range-rate observations. We classified the geophysical signals
into four distinct categories: oceanic, meteorological, hydrological, and solid
Earth, focusing primarily on the first three categories in this study. In our
examination of oceanic processes, we identified notable mass anomalies in the
Argentine basin, specifically within the Zapiola Rise, where persistent
remnants of the rotating dipole-like modes are evident in the LGD post-fit
residuals. Our analysis extended to the Gulf of Carpentaria and Australia
during the 2013 Oswald cyclone, revealing significant LGD residual anomalies
that correlate with cyclone tracking and precipitation data. Additionally, we
investigated the monsoon seasons in Bangladesh, particularly from June to
September 2007, where we observed peaks in sub-monthly variability. These
findings were further validated by demonstrating high spatial and temporal
correlations between gridded LGD residuals and ITSG-Grace2018 daily solutions.
Given that these anomalies are associated with significant mass change
phenomena, it is essential to integrate the post-fit residuals into a
high-frequency mass change framework, with the purpose of providing enhanced
spatial resolution compared to conventional Kalman-filtered methods.</p></br>
