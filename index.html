been proposed for the detection of solar filaments in H-alpha full-disk solar
images. The overall algorithm consists of three main steps of image processing.
These are image pre-processing, image segmentation, and image post-processing.
Here in the work, contours are initialized on the solar image and allowed to
deform based on the energy function. As soon as the contour reaches the
boundary of the desired object, the energy function gets reduced, and the
contour stops evolving. The proposed algorithm has been applied to few
benchmark datasets and has been compared with the classical technique of object
detection. The results analysis indicates that the proposed algorithm
outperforms the results obtained using the existing classical algorithm of
object detection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19883v1"><h2>A Neural Network-Based Search for Unmodeled Transients in
  LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's Third Observing Run</h2></a>Authors:  Ryan Raikman, Eric A. Moreno, Katya Govorkova, Siddharth Soni, Ethan Marx, William Benoit, Alec Gunny, Deep Chatterjee, Christina Reissel, Malina M. Desai, Rafia Omer, Muhammed Saleem, Philip Harris, Erik Katsavounidis, Michael W. Coughlin, Dylan Rankin</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>This paper presents the results of a Neural Network (NN)-based search for
short-duration gravitational-wave transients in data from the third observing
run of LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. The search targets unmodeled transients with
durations of milliseconds to a few seconds in the 30-1500 Hz frequency band,
without assumptions about the incoming signal direction, polarization, or
morphology. Using the Gravitational Wave Anomalous Knowledge (GWAK) method,
three compact binary coalescences (CBCs) identified by existing pipelines are
successfully detected, along with a range of detector glitches. The algorithm
constructs a low-dimensional embedded space to capture the physical features of
signals, enabling the detection of CBCs, detector glitches, and unmodeled
transients. This study demonstrates GWAK's ability to enhance
gravitational-wave searches beyond the limits of existing pipelines, laying the
groundwork for future detection strategies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20793v1"><h2>Robust Bayesian inference with gapped LISA data using all-in-one
  TDI-$\infty$</h2></a>Authors:  Niklas Houba, Jean-Baptiste Bayle, Michele Vallisneri</br>Comments: 47 pages, 15 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, gr-qc, physics.data-an, physics.ins-det</br><p>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA L-class mission, is
designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, with
operations expected to begin in the next decade. LISA will enable studies of
astrophysical phenomena such as massive black hole mergers, extreme mass ratio
inspirals, and compact binary systems. A key challenge in analyzing LISA's data
is the significant laser frequency noise, which must be suppressed using
time-delay interferometry (TDI). Classical TDI mitigates this noise by
algebraically combining phase measurements taken at different times and
spacecraft. However, data gaps caused by instrumental issues or operational
interruptions complicate the process. These gaps affect multiple TDI samples
due to the time delays inherent to the algorithm, rendering surrounding
measurements unusable for parameter inference. In this paper, we apply the
recently proposed variant of TDI known as TDI-$\infty$ to astrophysical
parameter inference, focusing on the challenge posed by data gaps. TDI-$\infty$
frames the LISA likelihood numerically in terms of raw measurements,
marginalizing over laser phase noises under the assumption of infinite noise
variance. Additionally, TDI-$\infty$ is set up to incorporate and cancel other
noise sources beyond laser noise, including optical bench motion, clock noise,
and modulation noise, establishing it as an all-in-one TDI solution. The method
gracefully handles measurement interruptions, removing the need to explicitly
address discontinuities during template matching. We integrate TDI-$\infty$
into a Bayesian framework, demonstrating its superior performance in scenarios
involving gaps. Compared to classical TDI, the method preserves signal
integrity more effectively and is particularly interesting for low-latency
applications, where the limited amount of available data makes data gaps
particularly disruptive.</p></br>
