  Analysis</h2></a>Authors:  Zhixin Guo, Qi Shi, Xiaofan Xu, Sixiang Shan, Limin Qin, Linqiang Ge, Rui Zhang, Ya Dai, Hua Zhu, Guowei Jiang</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>With the rapid advancement of aerospace technology and the large-scale
deployment of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, the challenges
facing astronomical observations and deep space exploration have become
increasingly pronounced. As a result, the demand for high-precision orbital
data on space objects-along with comprehensive analyses of satellite
positioning, constellation configurations, and deep space satellite
dynamics-has grown more urgent. However, there remains a notable lack of
publicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as
space object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This
study seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative
dataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset
integrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding
high-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and
multidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable
insights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the
evaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14757v1"><h2>Large Language Models -- the Future of Fundamental Physics?</h2></a>Authors:  Caroline Heneka, Florian Nieser, Ayodele Ore, Tilman Plehn, Daniel Schiller</br>Comments: 33 pages, 9 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, hep-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>For many fundamental physics applications, transformers, as the state of the
art in learning complex correlations, benefit from pretraining on
quasi-out-of-domain data. The obvious question is whether we can exploit Large
Language Models, requiring proper out-of-domain transfer learning. We show how
the Qwen2.5 LLM can be used to analyze and generate SKA data, specifically 3D
maps of the cosmological large-scale structure for a large part of the
observable Universe. We combine the LLM with connector networks and show, for
cosmological parameter regression and lightcone generation, that this Lightcone
LLM (L3M) with Qwen2.5 weights outperforms standard initialization and compares
favorably with dedicated networks of matching size.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14737v1"><h2>SETI@home: Data Analysis and Findings</h2></a>Authors:  David P. Anderson, Eric J. Korpela, Dan Werthimer, Jeff Cobb, Bruce Allen</br>Comments: 46 pages, 9 appendices, 20 figures, Accepted to AJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>SETI@home is a radio Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project
that looks for technosignatures in data recorded at the Arecibo Observatory.
The data were collected over a period of 14 years and cover almost the entire
sky visible to the telescope. The first stage of data analysis found billions
of detections: brief excesses of continuous or pulsed narrowband power. The
second stage removed detections that were likely radio frequency interference
(RFI), then identified and ranked signal candidates: groups of detections,
possibly spread over the 14 years, that plausibly originate from a single
cosmic source. We manually examined the top-ranking signal candidates and
selected a few hundred. In the third and final stage we are reobserving the
corresponding sky locations and frequency ranges using the Five-hundred-meter
Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) radio telescope. This paper covers
SETI@home's second stage of data analysis. We describe the algorithms used to
remove RFI and to identify and rank signal candidates. To guide the development
of these algorithms, we used artificial candidate birdies that model persistent
ET signals with a range of power, bandwidth, and planetary motion parameters.
This approach also allowed us to estimate the sensitivity of our detection
system to these signals.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12230v1"><h2>Statistical Machine Learning for Astronomy -- A Textbook</h2></a>Authors:  Yuan-Sen Ting</br>Comments: 677 pages, 152 figures. Code and tutorials available at
  https://github.com/tingyuansen/statml</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, stat.AP, stat.ML</br><p>This textbook provides a systematic treatment of statistical machine learning
for astronomical research through the lens of Bayesian inference, developing a
unified framework that reveals connections between modern data analysis
techniques and traditional statistical methods. We show how these techniques
emerge from familiar statistical foundations. The consistently Bayesian
perspective prioritizes uncertainty quantification and statistical rigor
essential for scientific inference in astronomy. The textbook progresses from
probability theory and Bayesian inference through supervised learning including
linear regression with measurement uncertainties, logistic regression, and
classification. Unsupervised learning topics cover Principal Component Analysis
and clustering methods. We then introduce computational techniques through
sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, followed by Gaussian Processes as
probabilistic nonparametric methods and neural networks within the broader
statistical context. Our theory-focused pedagogical approach derives each
method from first principles with complete mathematical development,
emphasizing statistical insight and complementing with astronomical
applications. We prioritize understanding why algorithms work, when they are
appropriate, and how they connect to broader statistical principles. The
treatment builds toward modern techniques including neural networks through a
solid foundation in classical methods and their theoretical underpinnings. This
foundation enables thoughtful application of these methods to astronomical
research, ensuring proper consideration of assumptions, limitations, and
uncertainty propagation essential for advancing astronomical knowledge in the
era of large astronomical surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14718v1"><h2>SETI@home: Data Acquisition and Front-End Processing</h2></a>Authors:  Eric J. Korpela, David P. Anderson, Jeff Cobb, Matt Lebofsky, Wei Liu, Dan Werthimer</br>Comments: 21 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables. Accepted to AJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.DC, physics.data-an</br><p>SETI@home is a radio Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project,
looking for technosignatures in data recorded at multiple observatories from
1998 to 2020. Most radio SETI projects analyze data using dedicated processing
hardware. SETI@home uses a different approach: time-domain data is distributed
over the Internet to $\gt 10^{5}$ volunteered home computers, which analyze it.
The large amount of computing power this affords ($\sim 10^{15}$ floating-point
operations per second (FPOP/s)) allows us to increase the sensitivity and
generality of our search in three ways. We use coherent integration, a
technique in which data is transformed so that the power of drifting signals is
confined to a single discrete Fourier transform (DFT) bin. We perform this
coherent search over 123 000 Doppler drift rates in the range ($\pm$100 Hz
s$^{-1}$). Second, we search for a variety of signal types, such as pulsed
signals and arbitrary repeated waveforms. The analysis uses a range of DFT
sizes, with frequency resolutions ranging from 0.075 Hz to 1221 Hz. The front
end of SETI@home produces a set of detections that exceed thresholds in power
and goodness of fit. We accumulated $\sim 1.2\times 10^{10}$ such detections.
The back end of SETI@home takes these detections, identifies and removes radio
frequency interference (RFI), and looks for groups of detections that are
consistent with extraterrestrial origin and that persist over long timescales.
This paper describes the front end of SETI@home and provides parameters for the
primary data source, the Arecibo Observatory; the back end and its results are
described in a companion paper.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14270v1"><h2>NeuralPDR: Neural Differential Equations as surrogate models for
  Photodissociation Regions</h2></a>Authors:  Gijs VermariÃ«n, Thomas G. Bisbas, Serena Viti, Yue Zhao, Xuefei Tang, Rahul Ravichandran</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in Machine Learning: Science and Technology.
  Focus on ML and the Physical Sciences, Mach. Learn.: Sci. Technol (2025)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Computational astrochemical models are essential for helping us interpret and
understand the observations of different astrophysical environments. In the age
of high-resolution telescopes such as JWST and ALMA, the substructure of many
objects can be resolved, raising the need for astrochemical modeling at these
smaller scales, meaning that the simulations of these objects need to include
both the physics and chemistry to accurately model the observations. The
computational cost of the simulations coupling both the three-dimensional
hydrodynamics and chemistry is enormous, creating an opportunity for surrogate
models that can effectively substitute the chemical solver. In this work we
present surrogate models that can replace the original chemical code, namely
Latent Augmented Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. We train these
surrogate architectures on three datasets of increasing physical complexity,
with the last dataset derived directly from a three-dimensional simulation of a
molecular cloud using a Photodissociation Region (PDR) code, 3D-PDR. We show
that these surrogate models can provide speedup and reproduce the original
observable column density maps of the dataset. This enables the rapid inference
of the chemistry (on the GPU), allowing for the faster statistical inference of
observations or increasing the resolution in hydrodynamical simulations of
astrophysical environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.14894v1"><h2>The Quasi-Radial Field-line Tracing (QRaFT): an Adaptive Segmentation of
  the Open-Flux Solar Corona</h2></a>Authors:  Vadim M. Uritsky, Christopher E. Rura, Cooper Downs, Shaela I. Jones, Charles Nickolos Arge, Nathalia Alzate</br>Comments: 20 pages, 11 figures, 2 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, physics.data-an, physics.plasm-ph, physics.space-ph</br><p>Optical observations of solar corona provide key information on its magnetic
geometry. The large-scale open field of the corona plays an important role in
shaping the ambient solar wind and constraining the propagation dynamics of the
embedded structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections. Rigorous
analysis of the open-flux coronal regions based on coronagraph images can be
quite challenging because of the depleted plasma density resulting in low
signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we present an in-depth description of a
new image segmentation methodology, the Quasi-Radial Field-line Tracing
(QRaFT), enabling a detection of field-aligned optical coronal features
approximating the orientation of the steady-state open magnetic field. The
methodology is tested using synthetic coronagraph images generated by a
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model. The results of the numerical tests
indicate that the extracted optical features are aligned within $\sim 4-7$
degrees with the local magnetic field in the underlying numerical solution. We
also demonstrate the performance of the method on real-life coronal images
obtained from a space-borne coronagraph and a ground-based camera. We argue
that QRaFT outputs contain valuable empirical information about the global
steady-state morphology of the corona which could help improving the accuracy
of coronal and solar wind models and space weather forecasts.</p></br>
