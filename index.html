  Relationships between Solar Flares and Source Active Regions</h2></a>Authors:  Huseyin Cavus, Jason T. L. Wang, Teja P. S. Singampalli, Gani Caglar Coban, Hongyang Zhang, Abd-ur Raheem, Haimin Wang</br>Comments: 16 pages, 9 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.LG, physics.space-ph</br><p>Solar flares are defined as outbursts on the surface of the Sun. They occur
when energy accumulated in magnetic fields enclosing solar active regions (ARs)
is abruptly expelled. Solar flares and associated coronal mass ejections are
sources of space weather that adversely impact devices at or near Earth,
including the obstruction of high-frequency radio waves utilized for
communication and the deterioration of power grid operations. Tracking and
delivering early and precise predictions of solar flares is essential for
readiness and catastrophe risk mitigation. This paper employs the random forest
(RF) model to address the binary classification task, analyzing the links
between solar flares and their originating ARs with observational data gathered
from 2011 to 2021 by SolarMonitor.org and the XRT flare database. We seek to
identify the physical features of a source AR that significantly influence its
potential to trigger >=C-class flares. We found that the features of
AR_Type_Today, Hale_Class_Yesterday are the most and the least prepotent
features, respectively. NoS_Difference has a remarkable effect in
decision-making in both global and local interpretations.</p></br>
