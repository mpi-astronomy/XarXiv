  Application to Glitch Characterization</h2></a>Authors:  Alessandro Licciardi, Davide Carbone, Lamberto Rondoni, Alessandro Nagar</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Gravitational waves, first predicted by Albert Einstein within the framework
of general relativity, were confirmed in 2015 by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration,
marking a pivotal breakthrough in astrophysics. Despite this achievement, a key
challenge remains in distinguishing true gravitational wave signals from noise
artifacts, or "glitches," which can distort data and affect the quality of
observations. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as the Q-transform, are
widely used for signal processing, but face limitations when addressing certain
types of signals. In this study, we investigate the Wavelet Scattering
Transform (WST), a recent signal analysis method, as a complementary approach.
Theoretical motivation for WST arises from its stability under signal
deformations and its equivariance properties, which make it particularly suited
for the complex nature of gravitational wave data. Our experiments on the LIGO
O1a dataset show that WST simplifies classification tasks and enables the use
of more efficient architectures compared to traditional methods. Furthermore,
we explore the potential benefits of integrating WST with the Q-transform,
demonstrating that ensemble methods exploiting both techniques can capture
complementary features of the signal and improve overall performance. This work
contributes to advancing machine learning applications in gravitational wave
analysis, introducing refined preprocessing techniques that improve signal
detection and classification.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19450v1"><h2>Unsupervised Learning Approach to Anomaly Detection in Gravitational
  Wave Data</h2></a>Authors:  Ammar Fayad</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Gravitational waves (GW), predicted by Einstein's General Theory of
Relativity, provide a powerful probe of astrophysical phenomena and fundamental
physics. In this work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method
using variational autoencoders (VAEs) to analyze GW time-series data. By
training on noise-only data, the VAE accurately reconstructs noise inputs while
failing to reconstruct anomalies, such as GW signals, which results in
measurable spikes in the reconstruction error. The method was applied to data
from the LIGO H1 and L1 detectors. Evaluation on testing datasets containing
both noise and GW events demonstrated reliable detection, achieving an area
under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89. This study introduces VAEs as a robust,
unsupervised approach for identifying anomalies in GW data, which offers a
scalable framework for detecting known and potentially new phenomena in
physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19475v1"><h2>Effective Fine-Tuning of Vision-Language Models for Accurate Galaxy
  Morphology Analysis</h2></a>Authors:  Ruoqi Wang, Haitao Wang, Qiong Luo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.CV</br>All Categories: cs.CV, astro-ph.GA, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>Galaxy morphology analysis involves classifying galaxies by their shapes and
structures. For this task, directly training domain-specific models on large,
annotated astronomical datasets is effective but costly. In contrast,
fine-tuning vision foundation models on a smaller set of astronomical images is
more resource-efficient but generally results in lower accuracy. To harness the
benefits of both approaches and address their shortcomings, we propose
GalaxAlign, a novel method that fine-tunes pre-trained foundation models to
achieve high accuracy on astronomical tasks. Specifically, our method extends a
contrastive learning architecture to align three types of data in fine-tuning:
(1) a set of schematic symbols representing galaxy shapes and structures, (2)
textual labels of these symbols, and (3) galaxy images. This way, GalaxAlign
not only eliminates the need for expensive pretraining but also enhances the
effectiveness of fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on galaxy classification
and similarity search demonstrate that our method effectively fine-tunes
general pre-trained models for astronomical tasks by incorporating
domain-specific multi-modal knowledge.</p></br>
