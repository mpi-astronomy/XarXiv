Pruzhinskaya, Anastasia D. Lavrukhina, Timofey A. Semenikhi, Alina A. Volnova, Sreevarsha Sreejith, Vadim V. Krushinsky, Emmanuel Gangler, Emille E. O. Ishida, Matwey V. Kornilov, Konstantin L. Malanchev</br>Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>We present results from the SNAD VIII Workshop, during which we conducted the
first systematic anomaly search in the ZTF fields also observed by LSSTComCam
during Rubin Scientific Pipeline commissioning. Using the PineForest active
anomaly detection algorithm, we analysed four selected fields (two galactic and
two extragalactic) and visually inspected 400 candidates. As a result, we
discovered six previously uncatalogued variable stars, including RS~CVn, BY
Draconis, ellipsoidal, and solar-type variables, and refined classifications
and periods for six known objects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness
of the SNAD anomaly detection pipeline and provide a preview of the discovery
potential in the upcoming LSST data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05333v1"><h2>Causal Foundation Models: Disentangling Physics from Instrument
  Properties</h2></a>Authors:  Jeroen Audenaert, Daniel Muthukrishna, Paul F. Gregory, David W. Hogg, V. Ashley Villar</br>Comments: 8 pages, 5 figures. Accepted to the ICML 2025 Foundation Models for
  Structured Data Workshop and accepted to the Machine Learning for
  Astrophysics Workshop 2025</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.AI</br><p>Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a
fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical
phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments.
This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or
multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model
that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a
dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning.
Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same
target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured
under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for
the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated
astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars
observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),
our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation
models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These
results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation
models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and
highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation
learning for structured data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03707v1"><h2>CosmoBench: A Multiscale, Multiview, Multitask Cosmology Benchmark for
  Geometric Deep Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Ningyuan Huang, Richard Stiskalek, Jun-Young Lee, Adrian E. Bayer, Charles C. Margossian, Christian Kragh Jespersen, Lucia A. Perez, Lawrence K. Saul, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM</br><p>Cosmological simulations provide a wealth of data in the form of point clouds
and directed trees. A crucial goal is to extract insights from this data that
shed light on the nature and composition of the Universe. In this paper we
introduce CosmoBench, a benchmark dataset curated from state-of-the-art
cosmological simulations whose runs required more than 41 million core-hours
and generated over two petabytes of data. CosmoBench is the largest dataset of
its kind: it contains 34 thousand point clouds from simulations of dark matter
halos and galaxies at three different length scales, as well as 25 thousand
directed trees that record the formation history of halos on two different time
scales. The data in CosmoBench can be used for multiple tasks -- to predict
cosmological parameters from point clouds and merger trees, to predict the
velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

  Objects</h2></a>Authors:  Benjamin L. Davis, Mohamad Ali-Dib, Yujia Zheng, Zehao Jin, Kun Zhang, Andrea Valerio Macci√≤</br>Comments: Accepted to ML4Astro 2025 (Machine Learning for Astrophysics workshop
  at ICML 2025)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>The origins of the colors of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) represent a
crucial unresolved question, central to understanding the history of our Solar
System. Recent observational surveys have revealed correlations between the
eccentricity and inclination of TNOs and their colors. This has rekindled the
long-standing debate on whether these colors reflect the conditions of TNO
formation or their subsequent collisional evolution. In this study, we address
this question with 98.7% certainty, using a model-agnostic, data-driven
approach based on causal graphs. First, as a sanity check, we demonstrate how
our model can replicate the currently accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical
history, blindly and without any orbital modeling or physics-based assumptions.
In fact, our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune)
predicts the existence of an unknown perturbing body, i.e., Neptune. We then
show how this model predicts, with high certainty, that the color of TNOs is
the root cause of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way
around. This strongly suggests that the colors of TNOs reflect an underlying
dynamical property, most likely their formation location. Moreover, our causal
model excludes formation scenarios that invoke substantial color modification
by subsequent irradiation. We therefore conclude that the colors of TNOs are
predominantly primordial.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05313v1"><h2>Solar Flare Prediction Using LSTM and DLSTM with Sliding Window Pattern
  Recognition</h2></a>Authors:  Zeinab Hassani, Davud Mohammadpur, Hossein Safari</br>Comments: Published in the Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series, volume 279,
  2025, DOI: 10.3847/1538-4365/addc73</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to
predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog.
The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among
approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified,
highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex,
self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is
employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized
flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare
activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class
imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on
sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while
LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding
windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics,
particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87)
in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an
ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering
more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models
trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is
attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal
components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the
potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction
and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and
resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.</p></br>
