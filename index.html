  forecasting</h2></a>Authors:  Chiara Curletto, Paolo Massa, Valeria Tagliafico, Cristina Campi, Federico Benvenuto, Michele Piana, Andrea Tacchino</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.space-ph, 68T07, 85-04</br><p>Solar flares are the most explosive phenomena in the solar system and the
main trigger of the events' chain that starts from Coronal Mass Ejections and
leads to geomagnetic storms with possible impacts on the infrastructures at
Earth. Data-driven solar flare forecasting relies on either deep learning
approaches, which are operationally promising but with a low explainability
degree, or machine learning algorithms, which can provide information on the
physical descriptors that mostly impact the prediction. This paper describes a
web-based technological platform for the execution of a computational pipeline
of feature-based machine learning methods that provide predictions of the flare
occurrence, feature ranking information, and assessment of the prediction
performances.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02527v1"><h2>Self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning for costate initialization
  using Markov chain Monte Carlo</h2></a>Authors:  Jannik Graebner, Ryne Beeson</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY, math.OC</br><p>Global search and optimization of long-duration, low-thrust spacecraft
trajectories with the indirect method is challenging due to a complex solution
space and the difficulty of generating good initial guesses for the costate
variables. This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that
reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible
manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related
trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion
models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions.
We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the
aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is
employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model
using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint
violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for
separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical
experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve
sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of
Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa
circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a
partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior
Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method
for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a
separate dedicated global search.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01112v1"><h2>The causal structure of galactic astrophysics</h2></a>Authors:  Harry Desmond, Joseph Ramsey</br>Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures; submitted to MNRAS Letters</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, stat.AP, stat.ME</br><p>Data-driven astrophysics currently relies on the detection and
characterisation of correlations between objects' properties, which are then
used to test physical theories that make predictions for them. This process
fails to utilise information in the data that forms a crucial part of the
theories' predictions, namely which variables are directly correlated (as
opposed to accidentally correlated through others), the directions of these
determinations, and the presence or absence of confounders that correlate
variables in the dataset but are themselves absent from it. We propose to
recover this information through causal discovery, a well-developed methodology
for inferring the causal structure of datasets that is however almost entirely
unknown to astrophysics. We develop a causal discovery algorithm suitable for
astrophysical datasets and illustrate it on $\sim$5$\times10^5$ low-redshift
galaxies from the Nasa Sloan Atlas, demonstrating its ability to distinguish
physical mechanisms that are degenerate on the basis of correlations alone.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00873v1"><h2>Reducción de ruido por medio de autoencoders: caso de estudio con la
  señal GW150914</h2></a>Authors:  Fernanda Zapata Bascuñán, Darío Fernando Mendieta</br>Comments: in Spanish language, Presented at the RPIC 2023 (Information
  Processing and Control work Reunion)</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM</br><p>This brief study focuses on the application of autoencoders to improve the
quality of low-amplitude signals, such as gravitational events. A pre-existing
autoencoder was trained using cosmic event data, optimizing its architecture
and parameters. The results show a significant increase in the signal-to-noise
ratio of the processed signals, demonstrating the potential of autoencoders in
the analysis of small signals with multiple sources of interference.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01299v1"><h2>Enhancing the development of Cherenkov Telescope Array control software
  with Large Language Models</h2></a>Authors:  Dmitriy Kostunin, Elisa Jones, Vladimir Sotnikov, Valery Sotnikov, Sergo Golovachev, Alexandre Strube</br>Comments: EuCAIFCon 2025 proceedings</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>We develop AI agents based on instruction-finetuned large language models
(LLMs) to assist in the engineering and operation of the Cherenkov Telescope
Array Observatory (CTAO) Control and Data Acquisition Software (ACADA). These
agents align with project-specific documentation and codebases, understand
contextual information, interact with external APIs, and communicate with users
in natural language. We present our progress in integrating these features into
CTAO pipelines for operations and offline data analysis.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01733v1"><h2>Reducing Simulation Dependence in Neutrino Telescopes with Masked Point
  Transformers</h2></a>Authors:  Felix J. Yu, Nicholas Kamp, Carlos A. Argüelles</br>Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures, presented at the 39th International Cosmic Ray
  Conference (ICRC2025)</br>Primary Category: hep-ex</br>All Categories: hep-ex, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Machine learning techniques in neutrino physics have traditionally relied on
simulated data, which provides access to ground-truth labels. However, the
accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real
data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino
telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years,
self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing
dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised
training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers
and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data,
this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated
systematic uncertainties. This represents a fundamental departure from previous
machine learning applications in neutrino telescopes, paving the way for
substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification.</p></br>
