but face significant challenges in scalability, physical consistency, and
adherence to domain symmetries, limiting their utility as alternatives to
$N$-body simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based
generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates
gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an
informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts
in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large
geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model
successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000
halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing
diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant
computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a
generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational
clustering of structure formation, moving closer to physically realistic and
efficient simulators for the evolution of large-scale structures in the
universe.</p></br>
