  Machine Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Valentina Tardugno Poleo, Nora Eisner, David W. Hogg</br>Comments: Under review at The Astronomical Journal</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Differentiating between real transit events and false positive signals in
photometric time series data is a bottleneck in the identification of
transiting exoplanets, particularly long-period planets. This differentiation
typically requires visual inspection of a large number of transit-like signals
to rule out instrumental and astrophysical false positives that mimic planetary
transit signals. We build a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN)
to separate eclipsing binaries and other false positives from potential planet
candidates, reducing the number of light curves that require human vetting. Our
CNN is trained using the TESS light curves that were identified by Planet
Hunters citizen scientists as likely containing a transit. We also include the
background flux and centroid information. The light curves are visually
inspected and labeled by project scientists and are minimally pre-processed,
with only normalization and data augmentation taking place before training. The
median percentage of contaminants flagged across the test sectors is 18% with a
maximum of 37% and a minimum of 10%. Our model keeps 100% of the planets for 16
of the 18 test sectors, while incorrectly flagging one planet candidate (0.3%)
for one sector and two (0.6%) for the remaining sector. Our method shows
potential to reduce the number of light curves requiring manual vetting by up
to a third with minimal misclassification of planet candidates.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18918v1"><h2>Computing low-thrust transfers in the asteroid belt, a comparison
  between astrodynamical manipulations and a machine learning approach</h2></a>Authors:  Giacomo Acciarini, Laurent Beauregard, Dario Izzo</br>Comments: Paper presented and published in the proceedings of the 29th ISSFD
  Conference, Darmstadt, Germany, 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.space-ph</br><p>Low-thrust trajectories play a crucial role in optimizing scientific output
and cost efficiency in asteroid belt missions. Unlike high-thrust transfers,
low-thrust trajectories require solving complex optimal control problems. This
complexity grows exponentially with the number of asteroids visited due to
orbital mechanics intricacies. In the literature, methods for approximating
low-thrust transfers without full optimization have been proposed, including
analytical and machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose new
analytical approximations and compare their accuracy and performance to machine
learning methods. While analytical approximations leverage orbit theory to
estimate trajectory costs, machine learning employs a more black-box approach,
utilizing neural networks to predict optimal transfers based on various
attributes. We build a dataset of about 3 million transfers, found by solving
the time and fuel optimal control problems, for different time of flights,
which we also release open-source. Comparison between the two methods on this
database reveals the superiority of machine learning, especially for longer
transfers. Despite challenges such as multi revolution transfers, both
approaches maintain accuracy within a few percent in the final mass errors, on
a database of trajectories involving numerous asteroids. This work contributes
to the efficient exploration of mission opportunities in the asteroid belt,
providing insights into the strengths and limitations of different
approximation strategies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17156v1"><h2>The Scaling Law in Stellar Light Curves</h2></a>Authors:  Jia-Shu Pan, Yuan-Sen Ting, Yang Huang, Jie Yu, Ji-Feng Liu</br>Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ICML 2024 AI4Science workshop</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>Analyzing time series of fluxes from stars, known as stellar light curves,
can reveal valuable information about stellar properties. However, most current
methods rely on extracting summary statistics, and studies using deep learning
have been limited to supervised approaches. In this research, we investigate
the scaling law properties that emerge when learning from astronomical time
series data using self-supervised techniques. By employing the GPT-2
architecture, we show the learned representation improves as the number of
parameters increases from $10^4$ to $10^9$, with no signs of performance
plateauing. We demonstrate that a self-supervised Transformer model achieves
3-10 times the sample efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art supervised
learning model when inferring the surface gravity of stars as a downstream
task. Our research lays the groundwork for analyzing stellar light curves by
examining them through large-scale auto-regressive generative models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17667v1"><h2>Hunting for Polluted White Dwarfs and Other Treasures with Gaia XP
  Spectra and Unsupervised Machine Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Malia L. Kao, Keith Hawkins, Laura K. Rogers, Amy Bonsor, Bart H. Dunlap, Jason L. Sanders, M. H. Montgomery, D. E. Winget</br>Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ApJ on May 20, 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>White dwarfs (WDs) polluted by exoplanetary material provide the
unprecedented opportunity to directly observe the interiors of exoplanets.
However, spectroscopic surveys are often limited by brightness constraints, and
WDs tend to be very faint, making detections of large populations of polluted
WDs difficult. In this paper, we aim to increase considerably the number of WDs
with multiple metals in their atmospheres. Using 96,134 WDs with Gaia DR3 BP/RP
(XP) spectra, we constructed a 2D map using an unsupervised machine learning
technique called Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to
organize the WDs into identifiable spectral regions. The polluted WDs are among
the distinct spectral groups identified in our map. We have shown that this
selection method could potentially increase the number of known WDs with 5 or
more metal species in their atmospheres by an order of magnitude. Such systems
are essential for characterizing exoplanet diversity and geology.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18351v1"><h2>Evaluating Bayesian deep learning for radio galaxy classification</h2></a>Authors:  Devina Mohan, Anna M. M. Scaife</br>Comments: Accepted to the 40th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial
  Intelligence (UAI 2024)</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM</br><p>The radio astronomy community is rapidly adopting deep learning techniques to
deal with the huge data volumes expected from the next generation of radio
observatories. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a principled way to
model uncertainty in the predictions made by such deep learning models and will
play an important role in extracting well-calibrated uncertainty estimates on
their outputs. In this work, we evaluate the performance of different BNNs
against the following criteria: predictive performance, uncertainty calibration
and distribution-shift detection for the radio galaxy classification problem.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18095v1"><h2>Is machine learning good or bad for the natural sciences?</h2></a>Authors:  David W. Hogg, Soledad Villar</br>Comments: A Position Paper accepted for publication in the 2024 International
  Conference on Machine Learning</br>Primary Category: stat.ML</br>All Categories: stat.ML, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.data-an</br><p>Machine learning (ML) methods are having a huge impact across all of the
sciences. However, ML has a strong ontology - in which only the data exist -
and a strong epistemology - in which a model is considered good if it performs
well on held-out training data. These philosophies are in strong conflict with
both standard practices and key philosophies in the natural sciences. Here, we
identify some locations for ML in the natural sciences at which the ontology
and epistemology are valuable. For example, when an expressive machine learning
model is used in a causal inference to represent the effects of confounders,
such as foregrounds, backgrounds, or instrument calibration parameters, the
model capacity and loose philosophy of ML can make the results more
trustworthy. We also show that there are contexts in which the introduction of
ML introduces strong, unwanted statistical biases. For one, when ML models are
used to emulate physical (or first-principles) simulations, they introduce
strong confirmation biases. For another, when expressive regressions are used
to label datasets, those labels cannot be used in downstream joint or ensemble
analyses without taking on uncontrolled biases. The question in the title is
being asked of all of the natural sciences; that is, we are calling on the
scientific communities to take a step back and consider the role and value of
ML in their fields; the (partial) answers we give here come from the particular
perspective of physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19384v1"><h2>NeuralODEs for VLEO simulations: Introducing thermoNET for Thermosphere
  Modeling</h2></a>Authors:  Dario Izzo, Giacomo Acciarini, Francesco Biscani</br>Comments: Paper presented and published in the 29th ISSFD Conference,
  Darmstadt, Germany</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.LG, physics.space-ph</br><p>We introduce a novel neural architecture termed thermoNET, designed to
represent thermospheric density in satellite orbital propagation using a
reduced amount of differentiable computations. Due to the appearance of a
neural network on the right-hand side of the equations of motion, the resulting
satellite dynamics is governed by a NeuralODE, a neural Ordinary Differential
Equation, characterized by its fully differentiable nature, allowing the
derivation of variational equations (hence of the state transition matrix) and
facilitating its use in connection to advanced numerical techniques such as
Taylor-based numerical propagation and differential algebraic techniques.
Efficient training of the network parameters occurs through two distinct
approaches. In the first approach, the network undergoes training independently
of spacecraft dynamics, engaging in a pure regression task against ground truth
models, including JB-08 and NRLMSISE-00. In the second paradigm, network
parameters are learned based on observed dynamics, adapting through ODE
sensitivities. In both cases, the outcome is a flexible, compact model of the
thermosphere density greatly enhancing numerical propagation efficiency while
maintaining accuracy in the orbital predictions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17566v1"><h2>A deep-learning algorithm to disentangle self-interacting dark matter
  and AGN feedback models</h2></a>Authors:  David Harvey</br>Comments: Accepted Nature Astronomy</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, physics.comp-ph</br><p>Different models of dark matter can alter the distribution of mass in galaxy
clusters in a variety of ways. However, so can uncertain astrophysical feedback
mechanisms. Here we present a Machine Learning method that ''learns'' how the
impact of dark matter self-interactions differs from that of astrophysical
feedback in order to break this degeneracy and make inferences on dark matter.
We train a Convolutional Neural Network on images of galaxy clusters from
hydro-dynamic simulations. In the idealised case our algorithm is 80% accurate
at identifying if a galaxy cluster harbours collisionless dark matter, dark
matter with ${\sigma}_{\rm DM}/m = 0.1$cm$^2/$g or with ${\sigma}_{DM}/m =
1$cm$^2$/g. Whilst we find adding X-ray emissivity maps does not improve the
performance in differentiating collisional dark matter, it does improve the
ability to disentangle different models of astrophysical feedback. We include
noise to resemble data expected from Euclid and Chandra and find our model has
a statistical error of < 0.01cm$^2$/g and that our algorithm is insensitive to
shape measurement bias and photometric redshift errors. This method represents
a new way to analyse data from upcoming telescopes that is an order of
magnitude more precise and many orders faster, enabling us to explore the dark
matter parameter space like never before.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19178v1"><h2>Model-independent cosmological inference post DESI DR1 BAO measurements</h2></a>Authors:  Purba Mukherjee, Anjan Ananda Sen</br>Comments: 5 pages, 5 sets of figures. Comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, gr-qc</br><p>In this work, we implement Gaussian process regression to reconstruct the
expansion history of the universe in a model-agnostic manner, using the
Pantheon-Plus SN-Ia compilation in combination with two different BAO
measurements (SDSS-IV and DESI DR1). In both the reconstructions, the
$\Lambda$CDM model is always included in the 95\% confidence intervals. We find
evidence that the DESI LRG data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ is not an outlier
within our model-independent framework. We study the $\mathcal{O}m$-diagnostics
and the evolution of the total equation of state (EoS) of our universe, which
hint towards the possibility of a quintessence-like dark energy scenario with a
very slowly varying EoS, and a phantom-crossing in higher $z$. The entire
exercise is later complemented by considering two more SN-Ia compilations -
DES-5YR and Union3 - in combination with DESI BAO. Reconstruction with the DESI
BAO + DES-5YR SN data sets predicts that the $\Lambda$CDM model lies outside
the 3$\sigma$ confidence levels, whereas with DESI BAO + Union3 data, the
$\Lambda$CDM model is always included within 1$\sigma$. We also report
constraints on $H_0 r_d$ from our model-agnostic analysis, independent of the
pre-recombination physics. Our results point towards an $\approx$ 2$\sigma$
discrepancy between the DESI + Pantheon-Plus and DESI + DES-5YR data sets,
which calls for further investigation.</p></br>
