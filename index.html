  Algorithms for Solar Flare Class Prediction</h2></a>Authors:  Julia Bringewald</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, I.5.0</br><p>Solar flares are among the most powerful and dynamic events in the solar
system, resulting from the sudden release of magnetic energy stored in the
Sun's atmosphere. These energetic bursts of electromagnetic radiation can
release up to 10^32 erg of energy, impacting space weather and posing risks to
technological infrastructure and therefore require accurate forecasting of
solar flare occurrences and intensities. This study evaluates the predictive
performance of three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, k-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for classifying solar
flares into 4 categories (B, C, M, X). Using the dataset of 13 SHARP
parameters, the effectiveness of the models was evaluated in binary and
multiclass classification tasks. The analysis utilized 8 principal components
(PC), capturing 95% of data variance, and 100 PCs, capturing 97.5% of variance.
Our approach uniquely combines binary and multiclass classification with
different levels of dimensionality reduction, an innovative methodology not
previously explored in the context of solar flare prediction. Employing a
10-fold stratified cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter tuning
ensured robust model evaluation. Our findings indicate that Random Forest and
XGBoost consistently demonstrate strong performance across all metrics,
benefiting significantly from increased dimensionality. The insights of this
study enhance future research by optimizing dimensionality reduction techniques
and informing model selection for astrophysical tasks. By integrating this
newly acquired knowledge into future research, more accurate space weather
forecasting systems can be developed, along with a deeper understanding of
solar physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01642v1"><h2>Identifying Doppelganger Active Galactic Nuclei across redshifts from
  spectroscopic surveys</h2></a>Authors:  Shreya Sareen, Swayamtrupta Panda</br>Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure, submitted to AAS journals</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the
universe, making them valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However,
understanding how AGN properties evolve over cosmic time remains a fundamental
challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low redshift (nearby) can
serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying
spectral 'doppelg\"angers', AGNs with remarkably similar emission line
properties despite being separated by vast cosmic distances. We analyze key
spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data
Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C
IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (H$\beta$), and Iron (Fe II - optical and
UV) emission lines. We incorporated properties such as equivalent width,
velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half maximum (FWHM), and
continuum luminosities (135nm, 300nm, and 510nm) closest to these prominent
lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly
similar spectra, hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share
intrinsic properties with high-redshift ones. We showcase here one of the
better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03509v1"><h2>AnomalyMatch: Discovering Rare Objects of Interest with Semi-supervised
  and Active Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Pablo GÃ³mez, David O'Ryan</br>Comments: Journal submission in preparation</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM</br><p>Anomaly detection in large datasets is essential in fields such as astronomy
and computer vision; however, supervised methods typically require extensive
anomaly labelling, which is often impractical. We present AnomalyMatch, an
anomaly detection framework combining the semi-supervised FixMatch algorithm
using EfficientNet classifiers with active learning. By treating anomaly
detection as a semi-supervised binary classification problem, we efficiently
utilise limited labelled and abundant unlabelled images. We allow iterative
model refinement in a user interface for expert verification of high-confidence
anomalies and correction of false positives. Built for astronomical data,
AnomalyMatch generalises readily to other domains facing similar data
challenges. Evaluations on the GalaxyMNIST astronomical dataset and the
miniImageNet natural-image benchmark under severe class imbalance (1% anomalies
for miniImageNet) display strong performance: starting from five to ten
labelled anomalies and after three active learning cycles, we achieve an
average AUROC of 0.95 (miniImageNet) and 0.86 (GalaxyMNIST), with respective
AUPRC of 0.77 and 0.71. After active learning cycles, anomalies are ranked with
71% (miniImageNet) to 93% precision in the 1% of the highest-ranked images.
AnomalyMatch is tailored for large-scale applications, efficiently processing
predictions for 100 million images within three days on a single GPU.
Integrated into ESAs Datalabs platform, AnomalyMatch facilitates targeted
discovery of scientifically valuable anomalies in vast astronomical datasets.
Our results underscore the exceptional utility and scalability of this approach
for anomaly discovery, highlighting the value of specialised approaches for
domains characterised by severe label scarcity.</p></br>
