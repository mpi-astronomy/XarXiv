  Imbalance for Solar Flare Prediction</h2></a>Authors:  Junzhi Wen, Rafal A. Angryk</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.AI</br><p>Time series data plays a crucial role across various domains, making it
valuable for decision-making and predictive modeling. Machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) have shown promise in this regard, yet their performance
hinges on data quality and quantity, often constrained by data scarcity and
class imbalance, particularly for rare events like solar flares. Data
augmentation techniques offer a potential solution to address these challenges,
yet their effectiveness on multivariate time series datasets remains
underexplored. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method for
time series data named Mean Gaussian Noise (MGN). We investigate the
performance of MGN compared to eight existing basic data augmentation methods
on a multivariate time series dataset for solar flare prediction, SWAN-SF,
using a ML algorithm for time series data, TimeSeriesSVC. The results
demonstrate the efficacy of MGN and highlight its potential for improving
classification performance in scenarios with extremely imbalanced data. Our
time complexity analysis shows that MGN also has a competitive computational
cost compared to the investigated alternative methods.</p></br>
