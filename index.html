  Generative Adversarial Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Yu. Yu. Dubenskaya, A. P. Kryukov, E. O. Gres, S. P. Polyakov, E. B. Postnikov, P. A. Volchugov, A. A. Vlaskina, D. P. Zhurov</br>Comments: 19 pages, 10 figures, Proceedings of The 8th International Conference
  on Deep Learning in Computational Physics, June 19-21, 2024, Moscow, Russia</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, cs.LG</br><p>Modern Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) generate a huge
amount of data that must be classified automatically, ideally in real time.
Currently, machine learning-based solutions are increasingly being used to
solve classification problems. However, these classifiers require proper
training data sets to work correctly. The problem with training neural networks
on real IACT data is that these data need to be pre-labeled, whereas such
labeling is difficult and its results are estimates. In addition, the
distribution of incoming events is highly imbalanced. Firstly, there is an
imbalance in the types of events, since the number of detected gamma quanta is
significantly less than the number of protons. Secondly, the energy
distribution of particles of the same type is also imbalanced, since
high-energy particles are extremely rare. This imbalance results in poorly
trained classifiers that, once trained, do not handle rare events correctly.
Using only conventional Monte Carlo event simulation methods to solve this
problem is possible, but extremely resource-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose to perform data augmentation with artificially
generated events of the desired type and energy using conditional generative
adversarial networks (cGANs), distinguishing classes by energy values. In the
paper, we describe a simple algorithm for generating balanced data sets using
cGANs. Thus, the proposed neural network model produces both imbalanced data
sets for physical analysis as well as balanced data sets suitable for training
other neural networks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03959v1"><h2>Improving the Temporal Resolution of SOHO/MDI Magnetograms of Solar
  Active Regions Using a Deep Generative Model</h2></a>Authors:  Jialiang Li, Vasyl Yurchyshyn, Jason T. L. Wang, Haimin Wang, Yasser Abduallah, Khalid A. Alobaid, Chunhui Xu, Ruizhu Chen, Yan Xu</br>Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We present a novel deep generative model, named GenMDI, to improve the
temporal resolution of line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms of solar active regions
(ARs) collected by the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). Unlike previous studies that focus primarily
on spatial super-resolution of MDI magnetograms, our approach can perform
temporal super-resolution, which generates and inserts synthetic data between
observed MDI magnetograms, thus providing finer temporal structure and enhanced
details in the LOS data. The GenMDI model employs a conditional diffusion
process, which synthesizes images by considering both preceding and subsequent
magnetograms, ensuring that the generated images are not only of high-quality,
but also temporally coherent with the surrounding data. Experimental results
show that the GenMDI model performs better than the traditional linear
interpolation method, especially in ARs with dynamic evolution in magnetic
fields.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02456v1"><h2>Inferring Galactic Parameters from Chemical Abundances with
  Simulation-Based Inference</h2></a>Authors:  Tobias Buck, Berkay Günes, Giuseppe Viterbo, William H. Oliver, Sven Buder</br>Comments: submitted to A&A, comments welcome, all source code to reproduce this
  work can be found on GitHub under url: https://github.com/TobiBu/sbi-chempy</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an, physics.space-ph</br><p>Galactic chemical abundances provide crucial insights into fundamental
galactic parameters, such as the high-mass slope of the initial mass function
(IMF) and the normalization of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) rates. Constraining
these parameters is essential for advancing our understanding of stellar
feedback, metal enrichment, and galaxy formation processes. However,
traditional Bayesian inference techniques, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
(HMC), are computationally prohibitive when applied to large datasets of modern
stellar surveys. We leverage simulation-based-inference (SBI) as a scalable,
robust, and efficient method for constraining galactic parameters from stellar
chemical abundances and demonstrate its the advantages over HMC in terms of
speed, scalability, and robustness against model misspecifications. We combine
a Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) model, CHEMPY, with a neural network
emulator and a Neural Posterior Estimator (NPE) to train our SBI pipeline. Mock
datasets are generated using CHEMPY, including scenarios with mismatched
nucleosynthetic yields, with additional tests conducted on data from a
simulated Milky Way-like galaxy. SBI results are benchmarked against HMC-based
inference, focusing on computational performance, accuracy, and resilience to
systematic discrepancies. SBI achieves a $\sim75,600\times$ speed-up compared
to HMC, reducing inference runtime from $\gtrsim42$ hours to mere seconds for
thousands of stars. Inference on $1,000$ stars yields precise estimates for the
IMF slope ($\alpha_{\rm IMF} = -2.298 \pm 0.002$) and SN Ia normalization
($\log_{10}(N_{\rm Ia}) = -2.885 \pm 0.003$), deviating less than 0.05% from
the ground truth. SBI also demonstrates similar robustness to model
misspecification than HMC, recovering accurate parameters even with alternate
yield tables or data from a cosmological simulation. (shortened...)</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00821v1"><h2>AI Agents for Ground-Based Gamma Astronomy</h2></a>Authors:  D. Kostunin, V. Sotnikov, S. Golovachev, A. Strube</br>Comments: proceedings of ADASS2025 (submitted), original talk and demos:
  https://pretalx.com/adass2024/talk/TRFZKU/</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Next-generation instruments for ground-based gamma-ray astronomy are marked
by a substantial increase in complexity, featuring dozens of telescopes. This
leap in scale introduces significant challenges in managing system operations
and offline data analysis. Methods, which depend on advanced personnel training
and sophisticated software, become increasingly strained as system complexity
grows, making it more challenging to effectively support users in such a
multifaceted environment. To address these challenges, we propose the
development of AI agents based on instruction-finetuned large language models
(LLMs). These agents align with specific documentation and codebases,
understand the environmental context, operate with external APIs, and
communicate with humans in natural language. Leveraging the advanced
capabilities of modern LLMs, which can process and retain vast amounts of
information, these AI agents offer a transformative approach to system
management and data analysis by automating complex tasks and providing
intelligent assistance. We present two prototypes that integrate with the
Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory pipelines for operations and offline data
analysis. The first prototype automates data model implementation and
maintenance for the Configuration Database of the Array Control and Data
Acquisition (ACADA). The second prototype is an open-access code generation
application tailored for data analysis based on the Gammapy framework.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02112v1"><h2>Building Machine Learning Challenges for Anomaly Detection in Science</h2></a>Authors:  Elizabeth G.

not predicted by the known rules of science. Oftentimes, these anomalous events
or objects that do not conform to the norms are an indication that the rules of
science governing the data are incomplete, and something new needs to be
present to explain these unexpected outliers. The challenge of finding
anomalies can be confounding since it requires codifying a complete knowledge
of the known scientific behaviors and then projecting these known behaviors on
the data to look for deviations. When utilizing machine learning, this presents
a particular challenge since we require that the model not only understands
scientific data perfectly but also recognizes when the data is inconsistent and
out of the scope of its trained behavior. In this paper, we present three
datasets aimed at developing machine learning-based anomaly detection for
disparate scientific domains covering astrophysics, genomics, and polar
science. We present the different datasets along with a scheme to make machine
learning challenges around the three datasets findable, accessible,
interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, we present an approach that
generalizes to future machine learning challenges, enabling the possibility of
large, more compute-intensive challenges that can ultimately lead to scientific
discovery.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04227v1"><h2>Potential of Ka-band Range Rate Post-fit Residuals for High-frequency
  Mass Change Applications</h2></a>Authors:  Michal Cuadrat-Grzybowski, Joao G. Teixeira da Encarnacao, Pieter N. A. M. Visser</br>Comments: To be later submitted to JGR: Solid Earth (AGU) later in March 2025</br>Primary Category: physics.geo-ph</br>All Categories: physics.geo-ph, astro-ph.EP, physics.ao-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>We present the first extensive analysis of K/Ka-band ranging post-fit
residuals of an official Level-2 product, characterised as Line-of-Sight
Gravity Differences (LGD), which exhibit and showcase interesting sub-monthly
geophysical signals. These residuals, provided by CSR, were derived from the
difference between spherical harmonic coefficient least-squares fits and
reduced Level-1B range-rate observations. We classified the geophysical signals
into four distinct categories: oceanic, meteorological, hydrological, and solid
Earth, focusing primarily on the first three categories in this study. In our
examination of oceanic processes, we identified notable mass anomalies in the
Argentine basin, specifically within the Zapiola Rise, where persistent
remnants of the rotating dipole-like modes are evident in the LGD post-fit
residuals. Our analysis extended to the Gulf of Carpentaria and Australia
during the 2013 Oswald cyclone, revealing significant LGD residual anomalies
that correlate with cyclone tracking and precipitation data. Additionally, we
investigated the monsoon seasons in Bangladesh, particularly from June to
September 2007, where we observed peaks in sub-monthly variability. These
findings were further validated by demonstrating high spatial and temporal
correlations between gridded LGD residuals and ITSG-Grace2018 daily solutions.
Given that these anomalies are associated with significant mass change
phenomena, it is essential to integrate the post-fit residuals into a
high-frequency mass change framework, with the purpose of providing enhanced
spatial resolution compared to conventional Kalman-filtered methods.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02554v1"><h2>Towards a robust R2D2 paradigm for radio-interferometric imaging:
  revisiting DNN training and architecture</h2></a>Authors:  Amir Aghabiglou, Chung San Chu, Chao Tang, Arwa Dabbech, Yves Wiaux</br>Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.CV, cs.LG</br><p>The R2D2 Deep Neural Network (DNN) series was recently introduced for image
formation in radio interferometry. It can be understood as a learned version of
CLEAN, whose minor cycles are substituted with DNNs. We revisit R2D2 on the
grounds of series convergence, training methodology, and DNN architecture,
improving its robustness in terms of generalisability beyond training
conditions, capability to deliver high data fidelity, and epistemic
uncertainty. Firstly, while still focusing on telescope-specific training, we
enhance the learning process by randomising Fourier sampling integration times,
incorporating multi-scan multi-noise configurations, and varying imaging
settings, including pixel resolution and visibility-weighting scheme. Secondly,
we introduce a convergence criterion whereby the reconstruction process stops
when the data residual is compatible with noise, rather than simply using all
available DNNs. This not only increases the reconstruction efficiency by
reducing its computational cost, but also refines training by pruning out the
data/image pairs for which optimal data fidelity is reached before training the
next DNN. Thirdly, we substitute R2D2's early U-Net DNN with a novel
architecture (U-WDSR) combining U-Net and WDSR, which leverages wide
activation, dense connections, weight normalisation, and low-rank convolution
to improve feature reuse and reconstruction precision. As previously, R2D2 was
trained for monochromatic intensity imaging with the Very Large Array (VLA) at
fixed $512 \times 512$ image size. Simulations on a wide range of inverse
problems and a case study on real data reveal that the new R2D2 model
consistently outperforms its earlier version in image reconstruction quality,
data fidelity, and epistemic uncertainty.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02914v1"><h2>Monitoring of the offset between UTC and its prediction broadcast by the

values of the offset between UTC and the predictions of UTC broadcast by the
GNSS, this quantity we name bUTC_GNSS. In this approach, the determination of
UTC - bUTC_GNSS is based on data collected by several multi-GNSS stations in
selected time laboratories worldwide. Test computations over a 7-month period
from July 2022 to January 2023 show that the offset between UTC and bUTC_GNSS
was between 30 and 50 ns for GLONASS, between 5 and 20 ns for BeiDou, and
between -5 and +5 ns for GPS and Galileo. We derive the uncertainty on the
reported values, which is 4.1 ns for BeiDou and GPS, 3.7 ns for Galileo and 6.6
ns for GLONASS and show that, over the test period, the reported values of UTC
- bUTC_GNSS and the solutions obtained from each multi-GNSS station are all
consistent within the 1-sigma uncertainties.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03237v1"><h2>Prediction of Halo Coronal Mass Ejections Using SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic
  Data Products and a Transformer Model</h2></a>Authors:  Hongyang Zhang, Ju Jing, Jason T. L. Wang, Haimin Wang, Yasser Abduallah, Yan Xu, Khalid A. Alobaid, Hameedullah Farooki, Vasyl Yurchyshyn</br>Comments: 13 pages, 8 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>We present a transformer model, named DeepHalo, to predict the occurrence of
halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Our model takes as input an active region
(AR) and a profile, where the profile contains a time series of data samples in
the AR that are collected 24 hours before the beginning of a day, and predicts
whether the AR would produce a halo CME during that day. Each data sample
contains physical parameters, or features, derived from photospheric vector
magnetic field data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on
board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We survey and match CME events in
the Space Weather Database Of Notification, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) and
Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) CME Catalog, and compile a
list of CMEs including halo CMEs and non-halo CMEs associated with ARs in the
period between November 2010 and August 2023. We use the information gathered
above to build the labels (positive versus negative) of the data samples and
profiles at hand, where the labels are needed for machine learning.
Experimental results show that DeepHalo with a true skill statistics (TSS)
score of 0.907 outperforms a closely related long short-term memory network
with a TSS score of 0.821. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the
transformer model has been used for halo CME prediction.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03816v1"><h2>The optical and infrared are connected</h2></a>Authors:  Christian K. Jespersen, Peter Melchior, David N. Spergel, Andy D. Goulding, ChangHoon Hahn, Kartheik G. Iyer</br>Comments: 17 pages, 14 figures. 12 pages of Appendix. Submitted to ApJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Galaxies are often modelled as composites of separable components with
distinct spectral signatures, implying that different wavelength ranges are
only weakly correlated. They are not. We present a data-driven model which
exploits subtle correlations between physical processes to accurately predict
infrared (IR) WISE photometry from a neural summary of optical SDSS spectra.
The model achieves accuracies of $\chi^2_N \approx 1$ for all photometric bands
in WISE, as well as good colors. We are also able to tightly constrain
typically IR-derived properties, e.g. the bolometric luminosities of AGN and
dust parameters such as $\mathrm{q_{PAH}}$. We find that current SED-fitting
methods are incapable of making comparable predictions, and that model
misspecification often leads to correlated biases in star-formation rates and
AGN luminosities. To help improve SED models, we determine what features of the
optical spectrum are responsible for our improved predictions, and identify
several lines (CaII, SrII, FeI, [OII] and H$\alpha$), which point to the
complex chronology of star formation and chemical enrichment being incorrectly
modelled.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01462v1"><h2>S-R2D2: a spherical extension of the R2D2 deep neural network series
  paradigm for wide-field radio-interferometric imaging</h2></a>Authors:  A. Tajja, A. Aghabiglou, E. Tolley, J-P. Kneib, J-P. Thiran, Y. Wiaux</br>Comments: 16 pages, 13 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.IV, eess.SP</br><p>Recently, the R2D2 paradigm, standing for ''Residual-to-Residual DNN series
for high-Dynamic-range imaging'', was introduced for image formation in Radio
Interferometry (RI) as a learned version of the traditional algorithm CLEAN.
The first incarnations of R2D2 are limited to planar imaging on small fields of
view, failing to meet the spherical-imaging requirement of modern telescopes
observing wide fields. To address this limitation, we propose the
spherical-imaging extension S-R2D2. Firstly, as R2D2, S-R2D2 encapsulates its
minor cycles in existing 2D-Euclidean deep neural network (DNN) architectures,
but adapts its iterative scheme to incorporate the wide-field measurement model
mapping a spherical image to visibility data. We implemented this model as the
composition of an efficient Fourier-based interpolator mapping the spherical
image onto the equatorial plane, with the standard RI operator mapping the
equatorial-plane image to visibility data. Importantly, the interpolation step
must inevitably be performed at a lower-than-optimal resolution on the plane,
to meet the high-resolution requirement on the sphere of wide-field imaging
while preserving scalability. Therefore, secondly, we design S-R2D2's DNN
training loss to jointly learn to correct the interpolation approximations and
identify residual image structures on the sphere, ensuring consistency with the
spherical ground truth using the adjoint plane-to-sphere interpolator. Finally,
we demonstrate through simulations S-R2D2's capability to perform fast and
accurate reconstructions of spherical monochromatic intensity images, across
high-resolution, high-dynamic-range settings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03799v1"><h2>DeepGrav: Anomalous Gravitational-Wave Detection Through Deep Latent
  Features</h2></a>Authors:  Jianqi Yan, Alex P. Leung, Zhiyuan Pei, David C. Y. Hui, Sangin Kim</br>Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, A concise introduction to the winning solution
  for NSF HDR A3D3 GW challenge. Our training code is publicly available at
  https://github.com/yan123yan/HDR-anomaly-challenge-submission</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.HE, gr-qc</br><p>This work introduces a novel deep learning-based approach for gravitational
wave anomaly detection, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional
matched filtering techniques in identifying unknown waveform gravitational wave
signals. We introduce a modified convolutional neural network architecture
inspired by ResNet that leverages residual blocks to extract high-dimensional
features, effectively capturing subtle differences between background noise and
gravitational wave signals. This network architecture learns a high-dimensional
projection while preserving discrepancies with the original input, facilitating
precise identification of gravitational wave signals. In our experiments, we
implement an innovative data augmentation strategy that generates new data by
computing the arithmetic mean of multiple signal samples while retaining the
key features of the original signals.
  In the NSF HDR A3D3: Detecting Anomalous Gravitational Wave Signals
competition, it is honorable for us (group name: easonyan123) to get to the
first place at the end with our model achieving a true negative rate (TNR) of
0.9708 during development/validation phase and 0.9832 on an unseen challenge
dataset during final/testing phase, the highest among all competitors. These
results demonstrate that our method not only achieves excellent generalization
performance but also maintains robust adaptability in addressing the complex
uncertainties inherent in gravitational wave anomaly detection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02880v1"><h2>A New $\sim 5σ$ Tension at Characteristic Redshift from DESI DR1

Comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, gr-qc, hep-th</br><p>We perform a model-independent reconstruction of the angular diameter
distance ($D_{A}$) using the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework with
DESI-DR1 BAO and DES-SN5YR datasets. We calibrate the comoving sound horizon at
the baryon drag epoch $r_d$ to the Planck best-fit value, ensuring consistency
with early-universe physics. With the reconstructed $D_A$ at two key redshifts,
$z\sim 1.63$ (where $D_{A}^{\prime} =0$) and at $z\sim 0.512$ (where
$D_{A}^{\prime} = D_{A}$), we derive the expansion rate of the Universe $H(z)$
at these redshifts. Our findings reveal that at $z\sim 1.63$, the $H(z)$ is
fully consistent with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM prediction, confirming no
new physics at that redshift. However, at $z \sim 0.512$, the derived $H(z)$
shows a more than $5\sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-2018 $\Lambda$CDM
prediction, suggesting a possible breakdown of the $\Lambda$CDM model as
constrained by Planck-2018 at this lower redshift. This emerging $\sim 5\sigma$
tension at $z\sim 0.512$, distinct from the existing ``Hubble Tension'', may
signal the first strong evidence for new physics at low redshifts.</p></br>
