  Generative Models</h2></a>Authors:  Yun Qi Li, Tuan Do, Evan Jones, Bernie Boscoe, Kevin Alfaro, Zooey Nguyen</br>Comments: 20 pages, 14 figures, 1 Table, code:

discoveries across scientific fields and require metrics capable of quantifying
the high dimensional output. We propose that astrophysics data, such as galaxy
images, can test generative models with additional physics-motivated ground
truths in addition to human judgment. For example, galaxies in the Universe
form and change over billions of years, following physical laws and
relationships that are both easy to characterize and difficult to encode in
generative models. We build a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) and a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and test their
ability to generate realistic galaxies conditioned on their redshifts (galaxy
ages). This is one of the first studies to probe these generative models using
physically motivated metrics. We find that both models produce comparable
realistic galaxies based on human evaluation, but our physics-based metrics are
better able to discern the strengths and weaknesses of the generative models.
Overall, the DDPM model performs better than the CVAE on the majority of the
physics-based metrics. Ultimately, if we can show that generative models can
learn the physics of galaxy evolution, they have the potential to unlock new
astrophysical discoveries.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05832v1"><h2>A Data-Driven Machine Learning Approach for Detecting Albedo Anomalies
  on the Lunar Surface</h2></a>Authors:  Sofia Strukova, Sergei Gleyzer, Patrick Peplowski, Jason P. Terry</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>This study introduces a data-driven approach using machine learning (ML)
techniques to explore and predict albedo anomalies on the Moon's surface. The
research leverages diverse planetary datasets, including
high-spatial-resolution albedo maps and element maps (LPFe, LPK, LPTh, LPTi)
derived from laser and gamma-ray measurements. The primary objective is to
identify relationships between chemical elements and albedo, thereby expanding
our understanding of planetary surfaces and offering predictive capabilities
for areas with incomplete datasets. To bridge the gap in resolution between the
albedo and element maps, we employ Gaussian blurring techniques, including an
innovative adaptive Gaussian blur. Our methodology culminates in the deployment
of an Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression Model, optimized to predict full
albedo based on elemental composition. Furthermore, we present an interactive
analytical tool to visualize prediction errors, delineating their spatial and
chemical characteristics. The findings not only pave the way for a more
comprehensive understanding of the Moon's surface but also provide a framework
for similar studies on other celestial bodies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07125v1"><h2>Rapid Parameter Estimation for Merging Massive Black Hole Binaries Using
  ODE-Based Generative Models</h2></a>Authors:  Bo Liang, Minghui Du, He Wang, Yuxiang Xu, Chang Liu, Xiaotong Wei, Peng Xu, Li-e Qiang, Ziren Luo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Detecting the coalescences of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is one of
the primary targets for space-based gravitational wave observatories such as
LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The fast and accurate parameter estimation of merging
MBHBs is of great significance for both astrophysics and the global fitting of
all resolvable sources. However, such analyses entail significant computational
costs. To address these challenges, inspired by the latest progress in
generative models, we proposed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) based
parameter estimation method called Variance Preserving Flow Matching Posterior
Estimation (VPFMPE). Specifically, we utilize triangular interpolation to
maintain variance over time, thereby constructing a transport path for training
continuous normalization flows. Compared to the simple linear interpolation
method used in flow matching to construct the optimal transport path, our
approach better captures continuous temporal variations, making it more
suitable for the parameter estimation of MBHBs. Additionally, we creatively
introduce a parameter transformation method based on the symmetry in the
detector's response function. This transformation is integrated within VPFMPE,
allowing us to train the model using a simplified dataset, and then perform
parameter estimation on more general data, hence also acting as a crucial
factor in improving the training speed. In conclusion, for the first time,
within a comprehensive and reasonable parameter range, we have achieved a
complete and unbiased 11-dimensional rapid inference for MBHBs in the presence
of astrophysical confusion noise using ODE-based generative models. In the
experiments based on simulated data, our model produces posterior distributions
comparable to those obtained by nested sampling.</p></br>
