  Gaussian Distributions</h2></a>Authors:  Andrew Sweet</br>Comments: 19 pages, 7 figures, Conference proceedings for ECML PKDD 2023</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.data-an</br><p>The advancement of technology has led to rampant growth in data collection
across almost every field, including astrophysics, with researchers turning to
machine learning to process and analyze this data. One prominent example of
this data in astrophysics is the atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets. In order
to help bridge the gap between machine learning and astrophysics domain
experts, the 2023 Ariel Data Challenge was hosted to predict posterior
distributions of 7 exoplanetary features. The procedure outlined in this paper
leveraged a combination of two deep learning models to address this challenge:
a Multivariate Gaussian model that generates the mean and covariance matrix of
a multivariate Gaussian distribution, and a Uniform Quantile model that
predicts quantiles for use as the upper and lower bounds of a uniform
distribution. Training of the Multivariate Gaussian model was found to be
unstable, while training of the Uniform Quantile model was stable. An ensemble
of uniform distributions was found to have competitive results during testing
(posterior score of 696.43), and when combined with a multivariate Gaussian
distribution achieved a final rank of third in the 2023 Ariel Data Challenge
(final score of 681.57).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12730v1"><h2>Predicting the energetic proton flux with a machine learning regression
  algorithm</h2></a>Authors:  Mirko Stumpo, Monica Laurenza, Simone Benella, Maria Federica Marcucci</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.space-ph</br><p>The need of real-time of monitoring and alerting systems for Space Weather
hazards has grown significantly in the last two decades. One of the most
important challenge for space mission operations and planning is the prediction
of solar proton events (SPEs). In this context, artificial intelligence and
machine learning techniques have opened a new frontier, providing a new
paradigm for statistical forecasting algorithms. The great majority of these
models aim to predict the occurrence of a SPE, i.e., they are based on the
classification approach. In this work we present a simple and efficient machine
learning regression algorithm which is able to forecast the energetic proton
flux up to 1 hour ahead by exploiting features derived from the electron flux
only. This approach could be helpful to improve monitoring systems of the
radiation risk in both deep space and near-Earth environments. The model is
very relevant for mission operations and planning, especially when flare
characteristics and source location are not available in real time, as at Mars
distance.</p></br>
