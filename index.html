  asteroid hazards</h2></a>Authors:  Amit Kumar Mondal, Nafisha Aslam, Prasenjit Maji, Hemanta Kumar Mondal</br>Comments: 17 pages, 12 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>The potential for catastrophic collision makes near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) a
serious concern. Planetary defense depends on accurately classifying
potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), however the complexity of the data
hampers conventional techniques. This work offers a sophisticated method for
accurately predicting hazards by combining machine learning, deep learning,
explainable AI (XAI), and anomaly detection. Our approach extracts essential
parameters like size, velocity, and trajectory from historical and real-time
asteroid data. A hybrid algorithm improves prediction accuracy by combining
several cutting-edge models. A forecasting module predicts future asteroid
behavior, and Monte Carlo simulations evaluate the likelihood of collisions.
Timely mitigation is made possible by a real-time alarm system that notifies
worldwide monitoring stations. This technique enhances planetary defense
efforts by combining real-time alarms with sophisticated predictive modeling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16690v1"><h2>Making the unmodulated pyramid wavefront sensor smart II. First on-sky
  demonstration of extreme adaptive optics with deep learning</h2></a>Authors:  R. Landman, S. Y. Haffert, J. D. Long, J. R. Males, L. M. Close, W. B. Foster, K. Van Gorkom, O. Guyon, A. D. Hedglen, P. T. Johnson, M. Y. Kautz, J. K. Kueny, J. Li, J. Liberman, J. Lumbres, E. A. McEwen, A. McLeod, L. Schatz, E. Tonucci, K. Twitchell</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG, physics.optics</br><p>Pyramid wavefront sensors (PWFSs) are the preferred choice for current and
future extreme adaptive optics (XAO) systems. Almost all instruments use the
PWFS in its modulated form to mitigate its limited linearity range. However,
this modulation comes at the cost of a reduction in sensitivity, a blindness to
petal-piston modes, and a limit to the sensor's ability to operate at high
speeds. Therefore, there is strong interest to use the PWFS without modulation,
which can be enabled with nonlinear reconstructors. Here, we present the first
on-sky demonstration of XAO with an unmodulated PWFS using a nonlinear
reconstructor based on convolutional neural networks. We discuss the real-time
implementation on the Magellan Adaptive Optics eXtreme (MagAO-X) instrument
using the optimized TensorRT framework and show that inference is fast enough
to run the control loop at >2 kHz frequencies. Our on-sky results demonstrate a
successful closed-loop operation using a model calibrated with internal source
data that delivers stable and robust correction under varying conditions.
Performance analysis reveals that our smart PWFS achieves nearly the same
Strehl ratio as the highly optimized modulated PWFS under favorable conditions
on bright stars. Notably, we observe an improvement in performance on a fainter
star under the influence of strong winds. These findings confirm the
feasibility of using the PWFS in its unmodulated form and highlight its
potential for next-generation instruments. Future efforts will focus on
achieving even higher control loop frequencies (>3 kHz), optimizing the
calibration procedures, and testing its performance on fainter stars, where
more gain is expected for the unmodulated PWFS compared to its modulated
counterpart.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18617v1"><h2>Scaling Laws for Emulation of Stellar Spectra</h2></a>Authors:  Tomasz Różański, Yuan-Sen Ting</br>Comments: 25 pages, 11 figures, submitted to OJA</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>Neural network-based emulators for the inference of stellar parameters and
elemental abundances represent an increasingly popular methodology in modern
spectroscopic surveys. However, these approaches are often constrained by their
emulation precision and domain transfer capabilities. Greater generalizability
has previously been achieved only with significantly larger model
architectures, as demonstrated by Transformer-based models in natural language
processing. This observation aligns with neural scaling laws, where model
performance predictably improves with increased model size, computational
resources allocated to model training, and training data volume. In this study,
we demonstrate that these scaling laws also apply to Transformer-based spectral
emulators in astronomy. Building upon our previous work with TransformerPayne
and incorporating Maximum Update Parametrization techniques from natural
language models, we provide training guidelines for scaling models to achieve
optimal performance. Our results show that within the explored parameter space,
clear scaling relationships emerge. These findings suggest that optimal
computational resource allocation requires balanced scaling. Specifically,
given a tenfold increase in training compute, achieving an optimal seven-fold
reduction in mean squared error necessitates an approximately 2.5-fold increase
in dataset size and a 3.8-fold increase in model size. This study establishes a
foundation for developing spectral foundational models with enhanced domain
transfer capabilities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17117v1"><h2>A New Statistical Model of Star Speckles for Learning to Detect and
  Characterize Exoplanets in Direct Imaging Observations</h2></a>Authors:  Théo Bodrito, Olivier Flasseur, Julien Mairal, Jean Ponce, Maud Langlois, Anne-Marie Lagrange</br>Comments: Accepted to CVPR 2025</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.CV, cs.LG, stat.AP</br><p>The search for exoplanets is an active field in astronomy, with direct
imaging as one of the most challenging methods due to faint exoplanet signals
buried within stronger residual starlight. Successful detection requires
advanced image processing to separate the exoplanet signal from this nuisance
component. This paper presents a novel statistical model that captures nuisance
fluctuations using a multi-scale approach, leveraging problem symmetries and a
joint spectral channel representation grounded in physical principles. Our
model integrates into an interpretable, end-to-end learnable framework for
simultaneous exoplanet detection and flux estimation. The proposed algorithm is
evaluated against the state of the art using datasets from the SPHERE
instrument operating at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). It significantly
improves the precision-recall trade-off, notably on challenging datasets that
are otherwise unusable by astronomers. The proposed approach is computationally
efficient, robust to varying data quality, and well suited for large-scale
observational surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17894v1"><h2>Generative AI for Validating Physics Laws</h2></a>Authors:  Maria Nareklishvili, Nicholas Polson, Vadim Sokolov</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA, cs.AI</br><p>We present generative artificial intelligence (AI) to empirically validate
fundamental laws of physics, focusing on the Stefan-Boltzmann law linking
stellar temperature and luminosity. Our approach simulates counterfactual
luminosities under hypothetical temperature regimes for each individual star
and iteratively refines the temperature-luminosity relationship in a deep
learning architecture. We use Gaia DR3 data and find that, on average,
temperature's effect on luminosity increases with stellar radius and decreases
with absolute magnitude, consistent with theoretical predictions. By framing
physics laws as causal problems, our method offers a novel, data-driven
approach to refine theoretical understanding and inform evidence-based policy
and practice.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16045v1"><h2>Open Science and Artificial Intelligence for supporting the

  Restoration</h2></a>Authors:  Suraj Singh, Anastasia Batsheva, Oleg Y. Rogov, Ahmed Bouridane</br>Comments: 10 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</br>Primary Category: cs.CV</br>All Categories: cs.CV, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, eess.IV</br><p>Contemporary image restoration and super-resolution techniques effectively
harness deep neural networks, markedly outperforming traditional methods.
However, astrophotography presents unique challenges for deep learning due to
limited training data. This work explores hybrid strategies, such as the Deep
Image Prior (DIP) model, which facilitates blind training but is susceptible to
overfitting, artifact generation, and instability when handling noisy images.
We propose enhancements to the DIP model's baseline performance through several
advanced techniques. First, we refine the model to process multiple frames
concurrently, employing the Back Projection method and the TVNet model. Next,
we adopt a Markov approach incorporating Monte Carlo estimation, Langevin
dynamics, and a variational input technique to achieve unbiased estimates with
minimal variance and counteract overfitting effectively. Collectively, these
modifications reduce the likelihood of noise learning and mitigate loss
function fluctuations during training, enhancing result stability. We validated
our algorithm across multiple image sets of astronomical and celestial objects,
achieving performance that not only mitigates limitations of Lucky Imaging, a
classical computer vision technique that remains a standard in astronomical
image reconstruction but surpasses the original DIP model, state of the art
transformer- and diffusion-based models, underscoring the significance of our
improvements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18670v1"><h2>Deep learning-based identification of precipitation clouds from all-sky
  camera data for observatory safety</h2></a>Authors:  Mohammad H. Zhoolideh Haghighi, Alireza Ghasrimanesh, Habib Khosroshahi</br>Comments: A version of this work has been published in Machine Learning with
  Applications (MLWA)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an, stat.ML</br><p>For monitoring the night sky conditions, wide-angle all-sky cameras are used
in most astronomical observatories to monitor the sky cloudiness. In this
manuscript, we apply a deep-learning approach for automating the identification
of precipitation clouds in all-sky camera data as a cloud warning system. We
construct our original training and test sets using the all-sky camera image
archive of the Iranian National Observatory (INO). The training and test set
images are labeled manually based on their potential rainfall and their
distribution in the sky. We train our model on a set of roughly 2445 images
taken by the INO all-sky camera through the deep learning method based on the
EfficientNet network. Our model reaches an average accuracy of 99\% in
determining the cloud rainfall's potential and an accuracy of 96\% for cloud
coverage. To enable a comprehensive comparison and evaluate the performance of
alternative architectures for the task, we additionally trained three models
LeNet, DeiT, and AlexNet. This approach can be used for early warning of
incoming dangerous clouds toward telescopes and harnesses the power of deep
learning to automatically analyze vast amounts of all-sky camera data and
accurately identify precipitation clouds formations. Our trained model can be
deployed for real-time analysis, enabling the rapid identification of potential
threats, and offering a scaleable solution that can improve our ability to
safeguard telescopes and instruments in observatories. This is important now
that numerous small and medium-sized telescopes are increasingly integrated
with smart control systems to reduce manual operation.</p></br>
