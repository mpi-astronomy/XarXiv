  galaxy intrinsic alignments</h2></a>Authors:  Yesukhei Jagvaral, Francois Lanusse, Rachel Mandelbaum</br>Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures. submitted to MNRAS</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Forthcoming cosmological imaging surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory LSST,
require large-scale simulations encompassing realistic galaxy populations for a
variety of scientific applications. Of particular concern is the phenomenon of
intrinsic alignments (IA), whereby galaxies orient themselves towards
overdensities, potentially introducing significant systematic biases in weak
gravitational lensing analyses if they are not properly modeled. Due to
computational constraints, simulating the intricate details of galaxy formation
and evolution relevant to IA across vast volumes is impractical. As an
alternative, we propose a Deep Generative Model trained on the IllustrisTNG-100
simulation to sample 3D galaxy shapes and orientations to accurately reproduce
intrinsic alignments along with correlated scalar features. We model the cosmic
web as a set of graphs, each graph representing a halo with nodes representing
the subhalos/galaxies. The architecture consists of a SO(3) $\times$
$\mathbb{R}^n$ diffusion generative model, for galaxy orientations and $n$
scalars, implemented with E(3) equivariant Graph Neural Networks that
explicitly respect the Euclidean symmetries of our Universe. The model is able
to learn and predict features such as galaxy orientations that are
statistically consistent with the reference simulation. Notably, our model
demonstrates the ability to jointly model Euclidean-valued scalars (galaxy
sizes, shapes, and colors) along with non-Euclidean valued SO(3) quantities
(galaxy orientations) that are governed by highly complex galactic physics at
non-linear scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17421v1"><h2>Solar Active Regions Emergence Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory
  Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Spiridon Kasapis, Irina N. Kitiashvili, Alexander G. Kosovichev, John T. Stefan</br>Comments: 20 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, under review at the AAS Astrophysical
  Journal</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>We developed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict the formation of
active regions (ARs) on the solar surface. Using the Doppler shift velocity,
the continuum intensity, and the magnetic field observations from the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), we have
created time-series datasets of acoustic power and magnetic flux, which are
used to train LSTM models on predicting continuum intensity, 12 hours in
advance. These novel machine learning (ML) models are able to capture
variations of the acoustic power density associated with upcoming magnetic flux
emergence and continuum intensity decrease. Testing of the models' performance
was done on data for 5 ARs, unseen from the models during training. Model 8,
the best performing model trained, was able to make a successful prediction of
emergence for all testing active regions in an experimental setting and three
of them in an operational. The model predicted the emergence of AR11726,
AR13165, and AR13179 respectively 10, 29, and 5 hours in advance, and
variations of this model achieved average RMSE values of 0.11 for both active
and quiet areas on the solar disc. This work sets the foundations for ML-aided
prediction of solar ARs.</p></br>
