  events in the TAIGA experiment</h2></a>Authors:  A. P. Kryukov, A. Yu. Razumov, A. P. Demichev, J. J. Dubenskaya, E. O. Gres, S. P. Polyakov, E. B. Postnikov, P. A. Volchugov, D. P. Zhurov</br>Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, Proceedings of The 9th International Conference
  on Deep Learning in Computational Physics, July, 2-4, 2025, Moscow, Russia</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, cs.LG</br><p>The objective of this work is to develop a method for detecting rare gamma
quanta against the background of charged particles in the fluxes from sources
in the Universe with the help of the deep learning and normalizing flows based
method designed for anomaly detection. It is shown that the suggested method
has a potential for the gamma detection. The method was tested on model data
from the TAIGA-IACT experiment. The obtained quantitative performance
indicators are still inferior to other approaches, and therefore possible ways
to improve the implementation of the method are proposed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17459v1"><h2>Estimating Orbital Parameters of Direct Imaging Exoplanet Using Neural
  Network</h2></a>Authors:  Bo Liang, Hanlin Song, Chang Liu, Tianyu Zhao, Yuxiang Xu, Zihao Xiao, Manjia Liang, Minghui Du, Wei-Liang Qian, Li-e Qiang, Peng Xu, Ziren Luo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>In this work, we propose a new flow-matching Markov chain Monte Carlo
(FM-MCMC) algorithm for estimating the orbital parameters of exoplanetary
systems, especially for those only one exoplanet is involved. Compared to
traditional methods that rely on random sampling within the Bayesian framework,
our approach first leverages flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) to
efficiently constrain the prior range of physical parameters, and then employs
MCMC to accurately infer the posterior distribution. For example, in the
orbital parameter inference of beta Pictoris b, our model achieved a
substantial speed-up while maintaining comparable accuracy-running 77.8 times
faster than Parallel Tempered MCMC (PTMCMC) and 365.4 times faster than nested
sampling. Moreover, our FM-MCMC method also attained the highest average
log-likelihood among all approaches, demonstrating its superior sampling
efficiency and accuracy. This highlights the scalability and efficiency of our
approach, making it well-suited for processing the massive datasets expected
from future exoplanet surveys. Beyond astrophysics, our methodology establishes
a versatile paradigm for synergizing deep generative models with traditional
sampling, which can be adopted to tackle complex inference problems in other
fields, such as cosmology, biomedical imaging, and particle physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16955v1"><h2>On the use of the Derivative Approximation for Likelihoods for
  Gravitational Wave Inference</h2></a>Authors:  Josiel Mendonça Soares de Souza, Miguel Quartin</br>Comments: 26 pages, 14 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, physics.data-an</br><p>Posterior inference on the more than a dozen parameters governing a
gravitational wave (GW) event is challenging. A typical MCMC analysis can take
around $100$ CPU hours, and next generation GW observatories will detect many
thousands of events. Here we present a thorough comparison of the accuracy and
computational cost of the Fisher Matrix, Derivative Approximation for
Likelihoods (DALI) and traditional MCMC methods. We find that using DALI, which
extends the traditional Fisher Matrix (FM) method to higher orders, allows for
a good approximation of the posterior with a $55$ times smaller computational
cost, and that the cost-benefit of the doublet-DALI is better than that of the
triplet-DALI. We also show that the singlet-DALI, a hybrid MCMC-Fisher method,
is much more accurate than the traditional FM and 10 times faster than the
doublet-DALI. A large effort has been invested in forecasting the science case
of different detector configurations, and the ability of making fast yet
accurate estimations of the posteriors is an important step forward. We also
introduce version \texttt{1.0} of the public \texttt{GWDALI} code, which
incorporates automatic differentiation, modern waveforms and an optimized
parameter decomposition.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18749v1"><h2>Symbolic Emulators for Cosmology: Accelerating Cosmological Analyses
  Without Sacrificing Precision</h2></a>Authors:  Deaglan J. Bartlett, Shivam Pandey</br>Comments: 22 pages, 6 figures. Invited contribution for the Royal Society
  Philosophical Transactions A special issue "Symbolic regression in the
  physical sciences"</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, cs.NE</br><p>In cosmology, emulators play a crucial role by providing fast and accurate
predictions of complex physical models, enabling efficient exploration of
high-dimensional parameter spaces that would be computationally prohibitive
with direct numerical simulations. Symbolic emulators have emerged as promising
alternatives to numerical approaches, delivering comparable accuracy with
significantly faster evaluation times. While previous symbolic emulators were
limited to relatively narrow prior ranges, we expand these to cover the
parameter space relevant for current cosmological analyses. We introduce
approximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\Lambda$CDM comoving
distance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and
0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0.1, 0.5]$.
We show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like
$3\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those
obtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer
substantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their
practical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19168v1"><h2>Transfer Learning Beyond the Standard Model</h2></a>Authors:  Veena Krishnaraj, Adrian E. Bayer, Christian Kragh Jespersen, Peter Melchior</br>Comments: 4+8 pages, 7 figures. Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop: Machine
  Learning and the Physical Sciences</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.data-an</br><p>Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically
requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models.
Transfer learning offers a way to reduce the simulation cost by reusing
knowledge across models. We show that pre-training on the standard model of
cosmology, $\Lambda$CDM, and fine-tuning on various beyond-$\Lambda$CDM
scenarios -- including massive neutrinos, modified gravity, and primordial
non-Gaussianities -- can enable inference with significantly fewer
beyond-$\Lambda$CDM simulations. However, we also show that negative transfer
can occur when strong physical degeneracies exist between $\Lambda$CDM and
beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameters. We consider various transfer architectures,
finding that including bottleneck structures provides the best performance. Our
findings illustrate the opportunities and pitfalls of foundation-model
approaches in physics: pre-training can accelerate inference, but may also
hinder learning new physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17959v1"><h2>Universal Spectral Tokenization via Self-Supervised Panchromatic
  Representation Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Jeff Shen, Francois Lanusse, Liam Holden Parker, Ollie Liu, Tom Hehir, Leopoldo Sarra, Lucas Meyer, Micah Bowles, Sebastian Wagner-Carena, Sebastian Wagner-Carena, Helen Qu, Siavash Golkar, Alberto Bietti, Hatim Bourfoune, Nathan Cassereau, Pierre Cornette, Keiya Hirashima, Geraud Krawezik, Ruben Ohana, Nicholas Lourie, Michael McCabe, Rudy Morel, Payel Mukhopadhyay, Mariel Pettee, Bruno Régaldo-Saint Blancard, Kyunghyun Cho, Miles Cranmer, Shirley Ho</br>Comments: Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences
  Workshop</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>Sequential scientific data span many resolutions and domains, and unifying
them into a common representation is a key step toward developing foundation
models for the sciences. Astronomical spectra exemplify this challenge: massive
surveys have collected millions of spectra across a wide range of wavelengths
and resolutions, yet analyses remain fragmented across spectral domains (e.g.,
optical vs. infrared) and object types (e.g., stars vs. galaxies), limiting the
ability to pool information across datasets. We present a deep learning model
that jointly learns from heterogeneous spectra in a self-supervised manner. Our
universal spectral tokenizer processes spectra from a variety of object types
and resolutions directly on their native wavelength grids, producing
intrinsically aligned, homogeneous, and physically meaningful representations
that can be efficiently adapted to achieve competitive performance across a
range of downstream tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a single
model can unify spectral data across resolutions and domains, suggesting that
our model can serve as a powerful building block for foundation models in
astronomy -- and potentially extend to other scientific domains with
heterogeneous sequential data, such as climate and healthcare.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18964v1"><h2>Dark Matter profiles of "in silico" galaxies: deep learning inference</h2></a>Authors:  Martín de los Rios, Serafina Di Gioia, Fabio Iocco, Roberto Trotta</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, physics.data-an</br><p>Machine learning has the potential to improve the reconstruction of the dark
matter profile of galaxies with respect to traditional methods, like rotation
curves. We demonstrate on the simulation suite Illustris-TNG that a steerable
equivariant convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to infer the dark matter
profiles within and around individual galaxies from photometric and
interferometric data, improving on a standard CNN. Within the in silico
environment of the simulations, our architecture is able to capture the dark
matter distribution within galaxies without a parametrization of the profile.
We perform an interpretability analysis to understand the internal mechanisms
of the trained model and the most important data features used to estimate the
dark matter profiles. The equivariant CNN recovers the dark matter profile of
galaxies within the stellar mass range $[10^{10} - 10^{12} ]$ $M_{\odot}$ with
excellent precision and accuracy: the mean squared error is reduced by a factor
of ~ 3 from its value under the training distribution, demonstrating that the
network has learnt from the data features. While this holds within the
controlled 'in silico' environment of the simulation, we argue that few
additional steps are needed before this method can be reliably applied to
galaxies in the real field observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19069v1"><h2>Hubble tension in an anisotropic Universe</h2></a>Authors:  Maksym Deliyergiyev, Morgan Le Delliou, Antonino Del Popolo</br>Comments: 19 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an, I.6.4; G.3; J.2</br><p>We explore the Hubble tension within an anisotropic cosmological framework by
revisiting the Bianchi type-I model introduced in Le Delliou et al. 2020.
Motivated by ongoing debates surrounding back-reaction effects and observed
anomalies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we investigate whether a
departure from isotropy in the late Universe could reconcile the observed
discrepancies in Hubble constant measurements. Using a Bayesian inference
framework, we constrain the model parameters employing multiple nested sampling
algorithms: bilby, PyMultiNest, and nessai. We perform the analysis under both
uniform and Gaussian priors, allowing us to systematically assess the
sensitivity of the inferred cosmological parameters to different prior
assumptions. This dual-prior strategy balances agnostic parameter exploration
with constraints informed by theory and observation. Our findings demonstrate
the reliability of our inference pipeline across different samplers and
emphasize the crucial role of prior selection in non-standard cosmological
model testing. The results suggest that anisotropic models remain viable
contenders in addressing current cosmological tensions: even though the present
model does not show alleviation of the Hubble tension, the data points towards
anisotropies. Future work may extend this methodology to more complex
anisotropic scenarios and incorporate additional cosmological probes such as
CMB polarization and gravitational wave standard sirens.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20795v1"><h2>Bayesian Inference of Primordial Magnetic Field Parameters from CMB with
  Spherical Graph Neural Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Juan Alejandro Pinto Castro, Héctor J. Hortúa, Jorge Enrique García-Farieta, Roger Anderson Hurtado</br>Comments: 16 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>Deep learning has emerged as a transformative methodology in modern
cosmology, providing powerful tools to extract meaningful physical information
from complex astronomical datasets. This paper implements a novel Bayesian
graph deep learning framework for estimating key cosmological parameters in a
primordial magnetic field (PMF) cosmology directly from simulated Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) maps. Our methodology utilizes DeepSphere, a
spherical convolutional neural network architecture specifically designed to
respect the spherical geometry of CMB data through HEALPix pixelization. To
advance beyond deterministic point estimates and enable robust uncertainty
quantification, we integrate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) into the
framework, capturing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties that reflect the
model confidence in its predictions. The proposed approach demonstrates
exceptional performance, achieving $R^{2}$ scores exceeding 0.89 for the
magnetic parameter estimation. We further obtain well-calibrated uncertainty
estimates through post-hoc training techniques including Variance Scaling and
GPNormal. This integrated DeepSphere-BNNs framework not only delivers accurate
parameter estimation from CMB maps with PMF contributions but also provides
reliable uncertainty quantification, providing the necessary tools for robust
cosmological inference in the era of precision cosmology.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20453v1"><h2>Symbolic Regression and Differentiable Fits in Beyond the Standard Model
  Physics</h2></a>Authors:  Shehu AbdusSalam, Steven Abel, Deaglan Bartlett, Miguel Crispim Romão</br>Comments: 18 pages, 4 figures</br>Primary Category: hep-ph</br>All Categories: hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, cs.AI, cs.LG, physics.comp-ph</br><p>We demonstrate the efficacy of symbolic regression (SR) to probe models of
particle physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM), by considering the so-called
Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM). Like many
incarnations of BSM physics this model has a number (four) of arbitrary
parameters, which determine the experimental signals, and cosmological
observables such as the dark matter relic density. We show that analysis of the
phenomenology can be greatly accelerated by using symbolic expressions derived
for the observables in terms of the input parameters. Here we focus on the
Higgs mass, the cold dark matter relic density, and the contribution to the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. We find that SR can produce remarkably
accurate expressions. Using them we make global fits to derive the posterior
probability densities of the CMSSM input parameters which are in good agreement
with those performed using conventional methods. Moreover, we demonstrate a
major advantage of SR which is the ability to make fits using differentiable
methods rather than sampling methods. We also compare the method with neural
network (NN) regression. SR produces more globally robust results, while NNs
require data that is focussed on the promising regions in order to be equally
performant.</p></br>
