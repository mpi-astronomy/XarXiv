  Classification Using Graph Neural Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Baimam Boukar Jean Jacques</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Classifying potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) is crucial for planetary
defense and deep space navigation, yet traditional methods often overlook the
dynamical relationships among asteroids. We introduce a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) approach that models asteroids as nodes with orbital and physical
features, connected by edges representing their similarities, using a NASA
dataset of 958,524 records. Despite an extreme class imbalance with only 0.22%
of the dataset with the hazardous label, our model achieves an overall accuracy
of 99% and an AUC of 0.99, with a recall of 78% and an F1-score of 37% for
hazardous asteroids after applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling
Technique. Feature importance analysis highlights albedo, perihelion distance,
and semi-major axis as main predictors. This framework supports planetary
defense missions and confirms AI's potential in enabling autonomous navigation
for future missions such as NASA's NEO Surveyor and ESA's Ramses, offering an
interpretable and scalable solution for asteroid hazard assessment.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.18624v1"><h2>Validation and Calibration of Semi-Analytical Models for the Event
  Horizon Telescope Observations of Sagittarius A*</h2></a>Authors:  Ali SaraerToosi, Avery Broderick</br>Comments: 26 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables, submitted to ApJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.HE</br>All Categories: astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, cs.CV, cs.LG, 85A99, 35Q75, 65C60, 62F15, I.2.6; G.1.10; I.4.10</br><p>The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) enables the exploration of black hole
accretion flows at event-horizon scales. Fitting ray-traced physical models to
EHT observations requires the generation of synthetic images, a task that is
computationally demanding. This study leverages \alinet, a generative machine
learning model, to efficiently produce radiatively inefficient accretion flow
(RIAF) images as a function of the specified physical parameters. \alinet has
previously been shown to be able to interpolate black hole images and their
associated physical parameters after training on a computationally tractable
set of library images. We utilize this model to estimate the uncertainty
introduced by a number of anticipated unmodeled physical effects, including
interstellar scattering and intrinsic source variability. We then use this to
calibrate physical parameter estimates and their associated uncertainties from
RIAF model fits to mock EHT data via a library of general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics models.</p></br>
