  learning</h2></a>Authors:  Vojtěch Cvrček, Martino Romaniello, Radim Šára, Wolfram Freudling, Pascal Ballester</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We applied machine learning to the entire data history of ESO's High Accuracy
Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument. Our primary goal was to
recover the physical properties of the observed objects, with a secondary
emphasis on simulating spectra. We systematically investigated the impact of
various factors on the accuracy and fidelity of the results, including the use
of simulated data, the effect of varying amounts of real training data, network
architectures, and learning paradigms. Our approach integrates supervised and
unsupervised learning techniques within autoencoder frameworks. Our methodology
leverages an existing simulation model that utilizes a library of existing
stellar spectra in which the emerging flux is computed from first principles
rooted in physics and a HARPS instrument model to generate simulated spectra
comparable to observational data. We trained standard and variational
autoencoders on HARPS data to predict spectral parameters and generate spectra.
Our models excel at predicting spectral parameters and compressing real
spectra, and they achieved a mean prediction error of approximately 50 K for
effective temperatures, making them relevant for most astrophysical
applications. Furthermore, the models predict metallicity ([M/H]) and surface
gravity (log g) with an accuracy of approximately 0.03 dex and 0.04 dex,
respectively, underscoring their broad applicability in astrophysical research.
The models' computational efficiency, with processing times of 779.6 ms on CPU
and 3.97 ms on GPU, makes them valuable for high-throughput applications like
massive spectroscopic surveys and large archival studies. By achieving accuracy
comparable to classical methods with significantly reduced computation time,
our methodology enhances the scope and efficiency of spectroscopic analysis.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10093v1"><h2>AI in the Cosmos</h2></a>Authors:  N. Sahakyan</br>Comments: In press in the International Journal of Modern Physics D; invited
  talk at the 17th Marcel Grossmann Meeting</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.HE</br>All Categories: astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing research by enabling the
efficient analysis of large datasets and the discovery of hidden patterns. In
astrophysics, AI has become essential, transforming the classification of
celestial sources, data modeling, and the interpretation of observations. In
this review, I highlight examples of AI applications in astrophysics, including
source classification, spectral energy distribution modeling, and discuss the
advancements achievable through generative AI. However, the use of AI
introduces challenges, including biases, errors, and the "black box" nature of
AI models, which must be resolved before their application. These issues can be
addressed through the concept of Human-Guided AI (HG-AI), which integrates
human expertise and domain-specific knowledge into AI applications. This
approach aims to ensure that AI is applied in a robust, interpretable, and
ethical manner, leading to deeper insights and fostering scientific excellence.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11837v1"><h2>The Eclipsing Binaries via Artificial Intelligence. II. Need for Speed
  in PHOEBE Forward Models</h2></a>Authors:  Marcin Wrona, Andrej Prša</br>Comments: Submitted to AAS Journals. 26 pages, 21 figures, 3 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>In modern astronomy, the quantity of data collected has vastly exceeded the
capacity for manual analysis, necessitating the use of advanced artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques to assist scientists with the most labor-intensive
tasks. AI can optimize simulation codes where computational bottlenecks arise
from the time required to generate forward models. One such example is PHOEBE,
a modeling code for eclipsing binaries (EBs), where simulating individual
systems is feasible, but analyzing observables for extensive parameter
combinations is highly time-consuming.
  To address this, we present a fully connected feedforward artificial neural
network (ANN) trained on a dataset of over one million synthetic light curves
generated with PHOEBE. Optimization of the ANN architecture yielded a model
with six hidden layers, each containing 512 nodes, provides an optimized
balance between accuracy and computational complexity. Extensive testing
enabled us to establish ANN's applicability limits and to quantify the
systematic and statistical errors associated with using such networks for EB
analysis. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of dilution effects in
parameter estimation for EBs, and we outline methods to incorporate these
effects in AI-based models.
  This proposed ANN framework enables a speedup of over four orders of
magnitude compared to traditional methods, with systematic errors not exceeding
1\%, and often as low as 0.01\%, across the entire parameter space.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10678v1"><h2>Efficient Summation of Arbitrary Masks -- ESAM</h2></a>Authors:  Vivek Gupta, Keith Bannister, Chris Flynn, Clancy James</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Searches for impulsive, astrophysical transients are often highly
computationally demanding. A notable example is the dedispersion process
required for performing blind searches for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in radio
telescope data. We introduce a novel approach - Efficient Summation of
Arbitrary Masks (ESAM) - which efficiently computes 1-D convolution of many
arbitrary 2-D masks, and can be used to carry out dedispersion over thousands
of dispersion trials efficiently. Our method matches the accuracy of the
traditional brute force technique in recovering the desired Signal-to-Noise
ratio (S/N) while reducing computational cost by around a factor of 10. We
compare its performance with existing dedispersion algorithms, such as the Fast
Dispersion Measure Transform (FDMT) algorithm, and demonstrate how ESAM
provides freedom to choose arbitrary masks and further optimise computational
cost versus accuracy. We explore the potential applications of ESAM beyond FRB
searches.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09832v1"><h2>Multivariate Time Series Clustering for Environmental State
  Characterization of Ground-Based Gravitational-Wave Detectors</h2></a>Authors:  Rutuja Gurav, Isaac Kelly, Pooyan Goodarzi, Anamaria Effler, Barry Barish, Evangelos Papalexakis, Jonathan Richardson</br>Comments: 8 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to The 5th International Workshop on Big
  Data & AI Tools, Methods, and Use Cases for Innovative Scientific Discovery
  (BTSD 2024)</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, gr-qc</br><p>Gravitational-wave observatories like LIGO are large-scale, terrestrial
instruments housed in infrastructure that spans a multi-kilometer geographic
area and which must be actively controlled to maintain operational stability
for long observation periods. Despite exquisite seismic isolation, they remain
susceptible to seismic noise and other terrestrial disturbances that can couple
undesirable vibrations into the instrumental infrastructure, potentially
leading to control instabilities or noise artifacts in the detector output. It
is, therefore, critical to characterize the seismic state of these
observatories to identify a set of temporal patterns that can inform the
detector operators in day-to-day monitoring and diagnostics. On a day-to-day
basis, the operators monitor several seismically relevant data streams to
diagnose operational instabilities and sources of noise using some simple
empirically-determined thresholds. It can be untenable for a human operator to
monitor multiple data streams in this manual fashion and thus a distillation of
these data-streams into a more human-friendly format is sought. In this paper,
we present an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for features-based
multivariate time series clustering to achieve this goal and to provide
actionable insights to the detector operators by correlating found clusters
with events of interest in the detector.</p></br>
