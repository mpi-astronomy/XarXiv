  NeurIPS 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>Recently, contrastive learning (CL), a technique most prominently used in
natural language and computer vision, has been used to train informative
representation spaces for galaxy spectra and images in a self-supervised
manner. Following this idea, we implement CL for stars in the Milky Way, for
which recent astronomical surveys have produced a huge amount of heterogeneous
data. Specifically, we investigate Gaia XP coefficients and RVS spectra. Thus,
the methods presented in this work lay the foundation for aggregating the
knowledge implicitly contained in the multimodal data to enable downstream
tasks like cross-modal generation or fused stellar parameter estimation. We
find that CL results in a highly structured representation space that exhibits
explicit physical meaning. Evaluating Using this representation space to
perform cross-modal generation and stellar label regression results in
excellent performance with high-quality generated samples as well as accurate
and precise label predictions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16347v1"><h2>Domain-Adaptive Neural Posterior Estimation for Strong Gravitational
  Lens Analysis</h2></a>Authors:  Paxson Swierc, Marcos Tamargo-Arizmendi, Aleksandra Ćiprijanović, Brian D. Nord</br>Comments: 20 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG</br><p>Modeling strong gravitational lenses is prohibitively expensive for modern
and next-generation cosmic survey data. Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a
simulation-based inference (SBI) approach, has been studied as an avenue for
efficient analysis of strong lensing data. However, NPE has not been
demonstrated to perform well on out-of-domain target data -- e.g., when trained
on simulated data and then applied to real, observational data. In this work,
we perform the first study of the efficacy of NPE in combination with
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). The source domain is noiseless, and the
target domain has noise mimicking modern cosmology surveys. We find that
combining UDA and NPE improves the accuracy of the inference by 1-2 orders of
magnitude and significantly improves the posterior coverage over an NPE model
without UDA. We anticipate that this combination of approaches will help enable
future applications of NPE models to real observational data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16116v1"><h2>Multimodal Flare Forecasting with Deep Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Grégoire Francisco, Sabrina Guastavino, Teresa Barata, João Fernandes, Dario Del Moro</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.CV</br><p>Solar flare forecasting mainly relies on photospheric magnetograms and
associated physical features to predict forthcoming flares. However, it is
believed that flare initiation mechanisms often originate in the chromosphere
and the lower corona. In this study, we employ deep learning as a purely
data-driven approach to compare the predictive capabilities of chromospheric
and coronal UV and EUV emissions across different wavelengths with those of
photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms. Our findings indicate that individual
EUV wavelengths can provide discriminatory power comparable or better to that
of line-of-sight magnetograms. Moreover, we identify simple multimodal neural
network architectures that consistently outperform single-input models, showing
complementarity between the flare precursors that can be extracted from the
distinct layers of the solar atmosphere. To mitigate potential biases from
known misattributions in Active Region flare catalogs, our models are trained
and evaluated using full-disk images and a comprehensive flare event catalog at
the full-disk level. We introduce a deep-learning architecture suited for
extracting temporal features from full-disk videos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15808v1"><h2>Mean-Field Simulation-Based Inference for Cosmological Initial
  Conditions</h2></a>Authors:  Oleg Savchenko, Florian List, Guillermo Franco Abellán, Noemi Anau Montel, Christoph Weniger</br>Comments: Accepted for the NeurIPS 2024 workshop Machine Learning and the
  Physical Sciences; 5 + 4 pages, 3 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Reconstructing cosmological initial conditions (ICs) from late-time
observations is a difficult task, which relies on the use of computationally
expensive simulators alongside sophisticated statistical methods to navigate
multi-million dimensional parameter spaces. We present a simple method for
Bayesian field reconstruction based on modeling the posterior distribution of
the initial matter density field to be diagonal Gaussian in Fourier space, with
its covariance and the mean estimator being the trainable parts of the
algorithm. Training and sampling are extremely fast (training: $\sim 1 \,
\mathrm{h}$ on a GPU, sampling: $\lesssim 3 \, \mathrm{s}$ for 1000 samples at
resolution $128^3$), and our method supports industry-standard
(non-differentiable) $N$-body simulators. We verify the fidelity of the
obtained IC samples in terms of summary statistics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17135v1"><h2>Reinforcement Learning for Data-Driven Workflows in Radio
  Interferometry. I. Principal Demonstration in Calibration</h2></a>Authors:  Brian M. Kirk, Urvashi Rau, Ramyaa Ramyaa</br>Comments: 22 pages, 13 figures; accepted for publication in The Astronomical
  Journal October 18, 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Radio interferometry is an observational technique used to study
astrophysical phenomena. Data gathered by an interferometer requires
substantial processing before astronomers can extract the scientific
information from it. Data processing consists of a sequence of calibration and
analysis procedures where choices must be made about the sequence of procedures
as well as the specific configuration of the procedure itself. These choices
are typically based on a combination of measurable data characteristics, an
understanding of the instrument itself, an appreciation of the trade-offs
between compute cost and accuracy, and a learned understanding of what is
considered "best practice". A metric of absolute correctness is not always
available and validity is often subject to human judgment. The underlying
principles and software configurations to discern a reasonable workflow for a
given dataset is the subject of training workshops for students and scientists.
Our goal is to use objective metrics that quantify best practice, and
numerically map out the decision space with respect to our metrics. With these
objective metrics we demonstrate an automated, data-driven, decision system
that is capable of sequencing the optimal action(s) for processing
interferometric data. This paper introduces a simplified description of the
principles behind interferometry and the procedures required for data
processing. We highlight the issues with current automation approaches and
propose our ideas for solving these bottlenecks. A prototype is demonstrated
and the results are discussed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17906v1"><h2>Leveraging Deep Learning for Time Series Extrinsic Regression in
  predicting photometric metallicity of Fundamental-mode RR Lyrae Stars</h2></a>Authors:  Lorenzo Monti, Tatiana Muraveva, Gisella Clementini, Alessia Garofalo</br>Comments: Sensors 2024, 24(16), 5203; (23 pages)</br>Primary Category: cs.AI</br>All Categories: cs.AI, astro-ph.IM</br><p>Astronomy is entering an unprecedented era of Big Data science, driven by
missions like the ESA's Gaia telescope, which aims to map the Milky Way in
three dimensions. Gaia's vast dataset presents a monumental challenge for
traditional analysis methods. The sheer scale of this data exceeds the
capabilities of manual exploration, necessitating the utilization of advanced
computational techniques. In response to this challenge, we developed a novel
approach leveraging deep learning to estimate the metallicity of fundamental
mode (ab-type) RR Lyrae stars from their light curves in the Gaia optical
G-band. Our study explores applying deep learning techniques, particularly
advanced neural network architectures, in predicting photometric metallicity
from time-series data. Our deep learning models demonstrated notable predictive
performance, with a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0565, the root mean
square error (RMSE) achieved is 0.0765 and a high $R^2$ regression performance
of 0.9401 measured by cross-validation. The weighted mean absolute error (wMAE)
is 0.0563, while the weighted root mean square error (wRMSE) is 0.0763. These
results showcase the effectiveness of our approach in accurately estimating
metallicity values. Our work underscores the importance of deep learning in
astronomical research, particularly with large datasets from missions like
Gaia. By harnessing the power of deep learning methods, we can provide
precision in analyzing vast datasets, contributing to more precise and
comprehensive insights into complex astronomical phenomena.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17142v1"><h2>Coniferest: a complete active anomaly detection framework</h2></a>Authors:  M. V.
