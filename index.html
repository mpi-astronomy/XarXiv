  Supervised Machine Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Nicole Hao, Laura Flagg, Ray Jayawardhana</br>Comments: re-submitted to ApJ after responding to referee report</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Flares are a well-studied aspect of the Sun's magnetic activity. Detecting
and classifying solar flares can inform the analysis of contamination caused by
stellar flares in exoplanet transmission spectra. In this paper, we present a
standardized procedure to classify solar flares with the aid of supervised
machine learning. Using flare data from the RHESSI mission and solar spectra
from the HARPS-N instrument, we trained several supervised machine learning
models, and found that the best performing algorithm is a C-Support Vector
Machine (SVC) with non-linear kernels, specifically Radial Basis Functions
(RBF). The best-trained model, SVC with RBF kernels, achieves an average
aggregate accuracy score of 0.65, and categorical accuracy scores of over 0.70
for the no-flare and weak-flare classes, respectively. In comparison, a blind
classification algorithm would have an accuracy score of 0.33. Testing showed
that the model is able to detect and classify solar flares in entirely new data
with different characteristics and distributions from those of the training
set. Future efforts could focus on enhancing classification accuracy,
investigating the efficacy of alternative models, particularly deep learning
models, and incorporating more datasets to extend the application of this
framework to stars that host exoplanets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14297v1"><h2>AI in Space for Scientific Missions: Strategies for Minimizing
  Neural-Network Model Upload</h2></a>Authors:  Jonah Ekelund, Ricardo Vinuesa, Yuri Khotyaintsev, Pierre Henri, Gian Luca Delzanno, Stefano Markidis</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.AI</br>All Categories: cs.AI, astro-ph.IM</br><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize space
exploration by delegating several spacecraft decisions to an onboard AI instead
of relying on ground control and predefined procedures. It is likely that there
will be an AI/ML Processing Unit onboard the spacecraft running an inference
engine. The neural-network will have pre-installed parameters that can be
updated onboard by uploading, by telecommands, parameters obtained by training
on the ground. However, satellite uplinks have limited bandwidth and
transmissions can be costly. Furthermore, a mission operating with a suboptimal
neural network will miss out on valuable scientific data. Smaller networks can
thereby decrease the uplink cost, while increasing the value of the scientific
data that is downloaded. In this work, we evaluate and discuss the use of
reduced-precision and bare-minimum neural networks to reduce the time for
upload. As an example of an AI use case, we focus on the NASA's Magnetosperic
MultiScale (MMS) mission. We show how an AI onboard could be used in the
Earth's magnetosphere to classify data to selectively downlink higher value
data or to recognize a region-of-interest to trigger a burst-mode, collecting
data at a high-rate. Using a simple filtering scheme and algorithm, we show how
the start and end of a region-of-interest can be detected in on a stream of
classifications. To provide the classifications, we use an established
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to an accuracy >94%. We also show
how the network can be reduced to a single linear layer and trained to the same
accuracy as the established CNN. Thereby, reducing the overall size of the
model by up to 98.9%. We further show how each network can be reduced by up to
75% of its original size, by using lower-precision formats to represent the
network parameters, with a change in accuracy of less than 0.6 percentage
points.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16730v1"><h2>Convolutional neural network for Lyman break galaxies classification and
  redshift regression in DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument)</h2></a>Authors:  Julien Taran</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.AI</br><p>DESI is a groundbreaking international project to observe more than 40
million quasars and galaxies over a 5-year period to create a 3D map of the
sky. This map will enable us to probe multiple aspects of cosmology, from dark
energy to neutrino mass. We are focusing here on one type of object observed by
DESI, the Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The aim is to use their spectra to
determine whether they are indeed LBGs, and if so, to determine their distance
from the Earth using a phenomenon called redshift. This will enable us to place
these galaxies on the DESI 3D map.
  The aim is therefore to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) inspired
by QuasarNET (See arXiv:1808.09955), performing simultaneously a classification
(LBG type or not) and a regression task (determine the redshift of the LBGs).
Initially, data augmentation techniques such as shifting the spectra in
wavelengths, adding noise to the spectra, or adding synthetic spectra were used
to increase the model training dataset from 3,019 data to over 66,000. In a
second phase, modifications to the QuasarNET architecture, notably through
transfer learning and hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian optimization, boosted
model performance.
  Gains of up to 26% were achieved on the Purity/Efficiency curve, which is
used to evaluate model performance, particularly in areas with interesting
redshifts, at low (around 2) and high (around 4) redshifts. The best model
obtained an average score of 94%, compared with 75% for the initial model.</p></br>
