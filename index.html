  Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Oisín Creaner, Anna Preis, Cormac Ryan, Nika Gorchakova</br>Comments: Author's manuscript version of paper accepted for publication in
  Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union, published by Cambridge
  University Press. Presented at Kavli-IAU Symposium 2024 "(Toward) Discovery
  of life beyond Earth and its impact". 5 pages, 2 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>We present the progress of work to streamline and simplify the process of
exoplanet observation by citizen scientists. International collaborations such
as ExoClock and Exoplanet Watch enable citizen scientists to use small
telescopes to carry out transit observations. These studies provide essential
supports for space missions such as JWST and ARIEL. Contributions include
maintenance or recovery of ephemerides, follow up confirmation and transit time
variations. Ongoing observation programs benefit from a large pool of
observers, with a wide variety of experience levels. Our projects work closely
with these communities to streamline their observation pipelines and enable
wider participation. Two complementary approaches are taken: Star Guide applies
human-centric design and community consultation to identify points of friction
within existing systems and provide complementary online tools and resources to
reduce barriers to entry to the observing community. Machine Learning is used
to accelerate data processing and automate steps which are currently manual,
providing a streamlined tool for citizen science and a scalable solution for
large-scale archival research.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14192v1"><h2>Strategic White Paper on AI Infrastructure for Particle, Nuclear, and
  Astroparticle Physics: Insights from JENA and EuCAIF</h2></a>Authors:  Sascha Caron, Andreas Ipp, Gert Aarts, Gábor Bíró, Daniele Bonacorsi, Elena Cuoco, Caterina Doglioni, Tommaso Dorigo, Julián García Pardiñas, Stefano Giagu, Tobias Golling, Lukas Heinrich, Ik Siong Heng, Paula Gina Isar, Karolos Potamianos, Liliana Teodorescu, John Veitch, Pietro Vischia, Christoph Weniger</br>Comments: 19 pages, 5 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, cs.AI, cs.LG, hep-ex, hep-ph, nucl-th</br><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming scientific research, with deep
learning methods playing a central role in data analysis, simulations, and
signal detection across particle, nuclear, and astroparticle physics. Within
the JENA communities-ECFA, NuPECC, and APPEC-and as part of the EuCAIF
initiative, AI integration is advancing steadily. However, broader adoption
remains constrained by challenges such as limited computational resources, a
lack of expertise, and difficulties in transitioning from research and
development (R&D) to production. This white paper provides a strategic roadmap,
informed by a community survey, to address these barriers. It outlines critical
infrastructure requirements, prioritizes training initiatives, and proposes
funding strategies to scale AI capabilities across fundamental physics over the
next five years.</p></br>
