  Model System</h2></a>Authors:  Xiaowen Zhang, Zhenyu Bi, Xuan Wang, Tiziana Di Matteo, Rupert A. C. Croft</br>Comments: 6 pages, 4 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.MA</br><p>As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly
complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of
literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense
academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these
parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone
process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the
cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system
designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and
preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by
specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software
validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured
communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful,
internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological
parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in
published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation
types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of
SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate
scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at:

available at https://github.com/xwzhang98/SimAgents.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10091v1"><h2>Non-Gaussian Expansion of Minkowski Tensors in Redshift Space</h2></a>Authors:  Stephen Appleby, Christophe Pichon, Pravabati Chingangbam, Dmitri Pogosyan, Changbom Park</br>Comments: 22 pages, 9 figures, submitted to ApJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an</br><p>This paper focuses on extending the use of Minkowski Tensors to analyze
anisotropic signals in cosmological data, focusing on those introduced by
redshift space distortion. We derive the ensemble average of the two
translation-invariant, rank-2 Minkowski Tensors for a matter density field that
is perturbatively non-Gaussian in redshift space. This is achieved through the
Edgeworth expansion of the joint probability density function of the field and
its derivatives, expressing the ensemble averages in terms of cumulants up to
cubic order. Our goal is to connect these theoretical predictions to the
underlying cosmological parameters, allowing for parameter estimation by
measuring them from galaxy surveys. The work builds on previous analyses of
Minkowski Functionals in both real and redshift space and addresses the effects
of Finger-of-God velocity dispersion and shot noise. We validate our
predictions by matching them to measurements of the Minkowski Tensors from dark
matter simulation data, finding that perturbation theory is a qualified
success. Non-perturbative Finger-of-God effects remain significant at
relatively large scales (R< 20 Mpc/h) and are particularly pronounced in the
components parallel to the line of sight.</p></br>
