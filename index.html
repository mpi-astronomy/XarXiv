  photometric redshift estimation</h2></a>Authors:  Qiufan Lin, Hengxin Ruan, Dominique Fouchez, Shupei Chen, Rui Li, Paulo Montero-Camacho, Nicola R. Napolitano, Yuan-Sen Ting, Wei Zhang</br>Comments: 22 + 6 pages, 9 + 5 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, cs.AI</br><p>Obtaining well-calibrated photometric redshift probability densities for
galaxies without a spectroscopic measurement remains a challenge. Deep learning
discriminative models, typically fed with multi-band galaxy images, can produce
outputs that mimic probability densities and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy.
However, such models may be affected by miscalibration that would result in
discrepancies between the model outputs and the actual distributions of true
redshifts. Our work develops a novel method called the Contrastive Learning and
Adaptive KNN for Photometric Redshift (CLAP) that resolves this issue. It
leverages supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and k-nearest neighbours (KNN)
to construct and calibrate raw probability density estimates, and implements a
refitting procedure to resume end-to-end discriminative models ready to produce
final estimates for large-scale imaging data. The harmonic mean is adopted to
combine an ensemble of estimates from multiple realisations for improving
accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that CLAP takes advantage of both deep
learning and KNN, outperforming benchmark methods on the calibration of
probability density estimates and retaining high accuracy and computational
efficiency. With reference to CLAP, we point out that miscalibration is
particularly sensitive to the method-induced excessive correlations among data
instances in addition to the unaccounted-for epistemic uncertainties. Reducing
the uncertainties may not guarantee the removal of miscalibration due to the
presence of such excessive correlations, yet this is a problem for conventional
deep learning methods rather than CLAP. These discussions underscore the
robustness of CLAP for obtaining photometric redshift probability densities
required by astrophysical and cosmological applications. This is the first
paper in our series on CLAP.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.17906v1"><h2>Leveraging Deep Learning for Time Series Extrinsic Regression in
  predicting photometric metallicity of Fundamental-mode RR Lyrae Stars</h2></a>Authors:  Lorenzo Monti, Tatiana Muraveva, Gisella Clementini, Alessia Garofalo</br>Comments: Sensors 2024, 24(16), 5203; (23 pages)</br>Primary Category: cs.AI</br>All Categories: cs.AI, astro-ph.IM</br><p>Astronomy is entering an unprecedented era of Big Data science, driven by
missions like the ESA's Gaia telescope, which aims to map the Milky Way in
three dimensions. Gaia's vast dataset presents a monumental challenge for
traditional analysis methods. The sheer scale of this data exceeds the
capabilities of manual exploration, necessitating the utilization of advanced
computational techniques. In response to this challenge, we developed a novel
approach leveraging deep learning to estimate the metallicity of fundamental
mode (ab-type) RR Lyrae stars from their light curves in the Gaia optical
G-band. Our study explores applying deep learning techniques, particularly
advanced neural network architectures, in predicting photometric metallicity
from time-series data. Our deep learning models demonstrated notable predictive
performance, with a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0565, the root mean
square error (RMSE) achieved is 0.0765 and a high $R^2$ regression performance
of 0.9401 measured by cross-validation. The weighted mean absolute error (wMAE)
is 0.0563, while the weighted root mean square error (wRMSE) is 0.0763. These
results showcase the effectiveness of our approach in accurately estimating
metallicity values. Our work underscores the importance of deep learning in
astronomical research, particularly with large datasets from missions like
Gaia. By harnessing the power of deep learning methods, we can provide
precision in analyzing vast datasets, contributing to more precise and
comprehensive insights into complex astronomical phenomena.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18875v1"><h2>Exploring the Universe with SNAD: Anomaly Detection in Astronomy</h2></a>Authors:  Alina A.

  continuous gravitational-wave searches</h2></a>Authors:  Matteo Di Giovanni, Paola Leaci, Pia Astone, Stefano Dal Pra, Sabrina D'Atonio, Luca D'Onofrio, Sergio Frasca, Federico Muciaccia, Cristiano Palomba, Lorenzo Pierini, Francesco Safai Tehrani</br>Comments: 13 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous
gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency
Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source
parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively
identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these
patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth
and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked
to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure
successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we
conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into
data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed
us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We
found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times
10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible
frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</p></br>
