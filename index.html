  gravitational-wave astronomy</h2></a>Authors:  Michele Mancarella, Davide Gerosa</br>Comments: 9+1 pages, 4+1 figures</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior
distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We
directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the
binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all
the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the
hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a
parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current
investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by
marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct
access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event
parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. Our
implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event
posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as
demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the
Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related
variances.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11823v1"><h2>SFTs: a scalable data-analysis framework for long-duration
  gravitational-wave signals</h2></a>Authors:  Rodrigo Tenorio, Davide Gerosa</br>Comments: 13 pages, 5 figures</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>We introduce a framework based on Short-time Fourier Transforms (SFTs) to
analyze long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binaries.
Targeted systems include binary neutron stars observed by third-generation
ground-based detectors and massive black-hole binaries observed by the LISA
space mission. In short, ours is an extremely fast, scalable, and
parallelizable implementation of the gravitational-wave inner product, a core
operation of gravitational-wave matched filtering. By operating on disjoint
data segments, SFTs allow for efficient handling of noise non-stationarities,
data gaps, and detector-induced signal modulations. We present a pilot
application to early warning problems in both ground- and space-based
next-generation detectors. Overall, SFTs reduce the computing cost of
evaluating an inner product by three to five orders of magnitude, depending on
the specific application, with respect to a standard approach. We release
public tools to operate using the SFT framework, including a vectorized and
hardware-accelerated re-implementation of a time-domain waveform. The inner
product is the key building block of all gravitational-wave data treatments; by
speeding up this low-level element so massively, SFTs provide an extremely
promising solution for current and future gravitational-wave data-analysis

  connected neural networks</h2></a>Authors:  A. P. Kryukov, S. P. Polyakov, Yu. Yu. Dubenskaya, E. O. Gres, E. B. Postnikov, P. A. Volchugov, D. P. Zhurov</br>Comments: The work was reported on the 8th International Conference on Deep

  Physics Bulletin</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, cs.LG</br><p>The direction of extensive air showers can be used to determine the source of
gamma quanta and plays an important role in estimating the energy of the
primary particle. The data from an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detector
stations HiSCORE in the TAIGA experiment registering the number of
photoelectrons and detection time can be used to estimate the shower direction
with high accuracy. In this work, we use artificial neural networks trained on
Monte Carlo-simulated TAIGA HiSCORE data for gamma quanta to obtain shower
direction estimates. The neural networks are multilayer perceptrons with skip
connections using partial data from several HiSCORE stations as inputs;
composite estimates are derived from multiple individual estimates by the
neural networks. We apply a two-stage algorithm in which the direction
estimates obtained in the first stage are used to transform the input data and
refine the estimates. The mean error of the final estimates is less than 0.25
degrees. The approach will be used for multimodal analysis of the data from
several types of detectors used in the TAIGA experiment.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13243v1"><h2>Learning the Universe: Learning to Optimize Cosmic Initial Conditions
  with Non-Differentiable Structure Formation Models</h2></a>Authors:  Ludvig Doeser, Metin Ata, Jens Jasche</br>Comments: 18 pages, 13 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Making the most of next-generation galaxy clustering surveys requires
overcoming challenges in complex, non-linear modelling to access the
significant amount of information at smaller cosmological scales. Field-level
inference has provided a unique opportunity beyond summary statistics to use
all of the information of the galaxy distribution. However, addressing current
challenges often necessitates numerical modelling that incorporates
non-differentiable components, hindering the use of efficient gradient-based
inference methods. In this paper, we introduce Learning the Universe by
Learning to Optimize (LULO), a gradient-free framework for reconstructing the
3D cosmic initial conditions. Our approach advances deep learning to train an
optimization algorithm capable of fitting state-of-the-art non-differentiable
simulators to data at the field level. Importantly, the neural optimizer solely
acts as a search engine in an iterative scheme, always maintaining full physics
simulations in the loop, ensuring scalability and reliability. We demonstrate
the method by accurately reconstructing initial conditions from
$M_{200\mathrm{c}}$ halos identified in a dark matter-only $N$-body simulation
with a spherical overdensity algorithm. The derived dark matter and halo
overdensity fields exhibit $\geq80\%$ cross-correlation with the ground truth
into the non-linear regime $k \sim 1h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Additional cosmological
tests reveal accurate recovery of the power spectra, bispectra, halo mass
function, and velocities. With this work, we demonstrate a promising path
forward to non-linear field-level inference surpassing the requirement of a
differentiable physics model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11134v1"><h2>Solving Online Resource-Constrained Scheduling for Follow-Up Observation
  in Astronomy: a Reinforcement Learning Approach</h2></a>Authors:  Yajie Zhang, Ce Yu, Chao Sun, Jizeng Wei, Junhan Ju, Shanjiang Tang</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.AI</br>All Categories: cs.AI, astro-ph.IM</br><p>In the astronomical observation field, determining the allocation of
observation resources of the telescope array and planning follow-up
observations for targets of opportunity (ToOs) are indispensable components of
astronomical scientific discovery. This problem is computationally challenging,
given the online observation setting and the abundance of time-varying factors
that can affect whether an observation can be conducted. This paper presents
ROARS, a reinforcement learning approach for online astronomical
resource-constrained scheduling. To capture the structure of the astronomical
observation scheduling, we depict every schedule using a directed acyclic graph
(DAG), illustrating the dependency of timing between different observation
tasks within the schedule. Deep reinforcement learning is used to learn a
policy that can improve the feasible solution by iteratively local rewriting
until convergence. It can solve the challenge of obtaining a complete solution
directly from scratch in astronomical observation scenarios, due to the high
computational complexity resulting from numerous spatial and temporal
constraints. A simulation environment is developed based on real-world
scenarios for experiments, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
scheduling approach. The experimental results show that ROARS surpasses 5
popular heuristics, adapts to various observation scenarios and learns
effective strategies with hindsight.</p></br>
