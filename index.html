  description length</h2></a>Authors:  Harry Desmond</br>Comments: 15 pages, 4 figures; Invited review for the Royal Society
  Philosophical Transactions A special issue "Symbolic regression in the
  physical sciences"</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions
from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will
describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an
unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good
function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in
their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive
search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which
allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in
units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive
Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the
expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in
galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm
identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general
purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12784v1"><h2>A Semi-Supervised Learning Method for the Identification of Bad
  Exposures in Large Imaging Surveys</h2></a>Authors:  Yufeng Luo, Adam D. Myers, Alex Drlica-Wagner, Dario Dematties, Salma Borchani, Frank Valdes, Arjun Dey, David Schlegel, Rongpu Zhou, DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Team</br>Comments: 21 pages, 12 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases,
traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by
human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based
approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a
focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e.,
$E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer
(ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor
(kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of
labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A
clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in
``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and
accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being
reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic
exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly
efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality
control in other large imaging surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11842v1"><h2>CosmoFlow: Scale-Aware Representation Learning for Cosmology with Flow
  Matching</h2></a>Authors:  Sidharth Kannan, Tian Qiu, Carolina Cuesta-Lazaro, Haewon Jeong</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><p>Generative machine learning models have been demonstrated to be able to learn
low dimensional representations of data that preserve information required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that flow matching based
generative models can learn compact, semantically rich latent representations
of field level cold dark matter (CDM) simulation data without supervision. Our
model, CosmoFlow, learns representations 32x smaller than the raw field data,
usable for field level reconstruction, synthetic data generation, and parameter
inference. Our model also learns interpretable representations, in which
different latent channels correspond to features at different cosmological
scales.</p></br>
