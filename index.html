for spacecraft navigation, orbit determination, and spacecraft systems
management. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging neural implicit
representations to model eclipse conditions efficiently and reliably. We
propose neural network architectures that capture the complex silhouettes of
asteroids and comets with high precision. Tested on four well-characterized
bodies - Bennu, Itokawa, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and Eros - our method
achieves accuracy comparable to traditional ray-tracing techniques while
offering orders of magnitude faster performance. Additionally, we develop an
indirect learning framework that trains these models directly from sparse
trajectory data using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, removing the
requirement to have prior knowledge of an accurate shape model. This approach
allows for the continuous refinement of eclipse predictions, progressively
reducing errors and improving accuracy as new trajectory data is incorporated.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05962v1"><h2>Autoencoder-Based Detection of Anomalous Stokes V Spectra in the
  Flare-Producing Active Region 13663 Using Hinode/SP Observations</h2></a>Authors:  Jargalmaa Batmunkh, Yusuke Iida, Takayoshi Oba</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR</br><p>Detecting unusual signals in observational solar spectra is crucial for
understanding the features associated with impactful solar events, such as
solar flares. However, existing spectral analysis techniques face challenges,
particularly when relying on pre-defined, physics-based calculations to process
large volumes of noisy and complex observational data. To address these
limitations, we applied deep learning to detect anomalies in the Stokes V
spectra from the Hinode/SP instrument. Specifically, we developed an
autoencoder model for spectral compression, which serves as an anomaly
detection method. Our model effectively identifies anomalous spectra within
spectro-polarimetric maps captured prior to the onset of the X1.3 flare on May
5, 2024, in NOAA AR 13663. These atypical spectral points exhibit highly
complex profiles and spatially align with polarity inversion lines in
magnetogram images, indicating their potential as sites of magnetic energy
storage and possible triggers for flares. Notably, the detected anomalies are
highly localized, making them particularly challenging to identify in
magnetogram images using current manual methods.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05235v1"><h2>IAEmu: Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations</h2></a>Authors:  Sneh Pandya, Yuanyuan Yang, Nicholas Van Alfen, Jonathan Blazek, Robin Walters</br>Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing
analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions
and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust
cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods
that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce
IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy
position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and
orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties
using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework.
Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for
$\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The
emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify
regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate
generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG
hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu
enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation
functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration
facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a
powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct
applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</p></br>
