binary flare prediction problem by embedding the intrinsic ordinal flare
characteristics into the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss function. This
modification is intended to provide the model with better guidance based on the
ordinal characteristics of the data and improve the overall performance of the
models. For our experiments, we employ a ResNet34-based model with transfer
learning to predict $\geq$M-class flares by utilizing the shape-based features
of magnetograms of active region (AR) patches spanning from $-$90$^{\circ}$ to
$+$90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude as our input data. We use a composite skill
score (CSS) as our evaluation metric, which is calculated as the geometric mean
of the True Skill Score (TSS) and the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) to rank and
compare our models' performance. The primary contributions of this work are as
follows: (i) We introduce a novel approach to encode ordinality into a binary
loss function showing an application to solar flare prediction, (ii) We enhance
solar flare forecasting by enabling flare predictions for each AR across the
entire solar disk, without any longitudinal restrictions, and evaluate and
compare performance. (iii) Our candidate model, optimized with the proposed
loss function, shows an improvement of $\sim$7%, $\sim$4%, and $\sim$3% for AR
patches within $\pm$30$^\circ$, $\pm$60$^\circ$, and $\pm$90$^\circ$ of solar
longitude, respectively in terms of CSS, when compared with standard BCE.
Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs in
near-limb regions (regions between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90$^{\circ}$) with
a CSS=0.34 (TSS=0.50 and HSS=0.23), expanding the scope of AR-based models for
solar flare prediction. This advances the reliability of solar flare forecasts,
leading to more effective prediction capabilities.</p></br>
