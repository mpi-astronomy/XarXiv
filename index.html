completely changed how exoplanets are discovered or characterised. This study
including star light curves from the Kepler dataset as a way to discover
exoplanets (planetary transits) and derive some estimate of their physical
characteristics by the light curve and machine learning methods. The dataset
consists of measured flux (recordings) for many individual stars and we will
examine the light curve of each star and look for periodic dips in brightness
due to an astronomical body making a transit. We will apply variables derived
from an established method for deriving measurements from light curve data to
derive key parameters related to the planet we observed during the transit,
such as distance to the host star, orbital period, radius. The orbital period
will typically be measured based on the time between transit of the subsequent
timelines and the radius will be measured based on the depth of transit. The
density of the star and planet can also be estimated from the transit event, as
well as very limited information on the albedo (reflectivity) and atmosphere of
the planet based on transmission spectroscopy and/or the analysis of phase
curve for levels of flux. In addition to these methods, we will employ some
machine learning classification of the stars (i.e. likely have an exoplanet or
likely do not have an exoplanet) based on flux change. This could help fulfil
both the process of looking for exoplanets more efficient as well as providing
important parameters for the planet. This will provide a much quicker means of
searching the vast astronomical datasets for the likelihood of exoplanets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17360v1"><h2>Algorithm to extract direction in 2D discrete distributions and a
  continuous Frobenius norm</h2></a>Authors:  Jeffrey G. Yepez, Jackson D. Seligman, Max A. A. Dornfest, Brian C. Crow, John G. Learned, Viacheslav A. Li</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: physics.data-an</br>All Categories: physics.data-an, astro-ph.IM</br><p>In this study, we present a novel algorithm for determining directionality in
2D distributions of discrete data. We compare a reference dataset with a known
direction to a measured dataset with an unknown direction by the Frobenius norm
of the difference (FND) to find the unknown direction. To generalize this
concept, we develop a continuous Frobenius norm of the difference (CFND) as a
continuous analog of the FND and derive its analytical expression. By relating
fitted and normalized 2D Gaussian distributions, we show that the CFND
approximates the FND, and we validate this relationship with computer
simulations. We find that a first-order approximation of the CFND between two
similar Gaussian distributions takes the form of an absolute sine function,
offering a simple analytical form with potential for specialized applications
in segmented inverse beta decay (IBD) neutrino detectors, astronomy, machine
learning, and more. Although this method may easily extend to 3D scalar fields,
our focus here is on 2D real-valued fields as it directly applies to
directionality. Our methodology consists of modeling a 2D Gaussian
distribution, binning the data into a histogram, and encoding it as a square
matrix. Rotating this matrix around its geometric center and comparing it to a
measured dataset using the FND gives us rotational data that we fit with an
absolute sine function. The location of the minimum of this fit is the angle
closest to the true angle of the direction in the measured dataset. We present
the derivation and discuss initial applications of the CFND in our novel
algorithm, demonstrating its success in approximating directionality in 2D
distributions.</p></br>
