  Binary Black Hole Waveforms</h2></a>Authors:  Osvaldo Gramaxo Freitas, Anastasios Theodoropoulos, Nino Villanueva, Tiago Fernandes, Solange Nunes, José A. Font, Antonio Onofre, Alejandro Torres-Forné, José D. Martin-Guerrero</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Gravitational wave approximants are widely used tools in gravitational-wave
astronomy. They allow for dense coverage of the parameter space of binary black
hole (BBH) mergers for purposes of parameter inference, or, more generally,
match filtering tasks, while avoiding the computationally expensive full
evolution of numerical relativity simulations. However, this comes at a slight
cost in terms of accuracy when compared to numerical relativity waveforms,
depending on the approach. One way to minimize this is by constructing
so-called~\textit{surrogate models} which, instead of using approximate physics
or phenomenological formulae, rather interpolate within the space of numerical
relativity waveforms. In this work, we introduce~\texttt{NRSurNN3dq4}, a
surrogate model for non-precessing BBH merger waveforms powered by neural
networks. By relying on the power of deep learning, this approximant is
remarkably fast and competitively accurate, as it can generate millions of
waveforms in a tenth of a second, while mismatches with numerical relativity
waveforms are restrained below $10^{-3}$. We implement this approximant within
the~\textsc{bilby} framework for gravitational-wave parameter inference, and
show that it it is suitable for parameter estimation tasks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08589v1"><h2>SPACE-SUIT: An Artificial Intelligence based chromospheric feature
  extractor and classifier for SUIT</h2></a>Authors:  Pranava Seth, Vishal Upendran, Megha Anand, Janmejoy Sarkar, Soumya Roy, Priyadarshan Chaki, Pratyay Chowdhury, Borishan Ghosh, Durgesh Tripathi</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.CV, cs.LG</br><p>The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope(SUIT) onboard Aditya-L1 is an imager
that observes the solar photosphere and chromosphere through observations in
the wavelength range of 200-400 nm. A comprehensive understanding of the plasma
and thermodynamic properties of chromospheric and photospheric morphological
structures requires a large sample statistical study, necessitating the
development of automatic feature detection methods. To this end, we develop the
feature detection algorithm SPACE-SUIT: Solar Phenomena Analysis and
Classification using Enhanced vision techniques for SUIT, to detect and
classify the solar chromospheric features to be observed from SUIT's Mg II k
filter. Specifically, we target plage regions, sunspots, filaments, and
off-limb structures. SPACE uses You Only Look Once(YOLO), a neural
network-based model to identify regions of interest. We train and validate
SPACE using mock-SUIT images developed from Interface Region Imaging
Spectrometer(IRIS) full-disk mosaic images in Mg II k line, while we also
perform detection on Level-1 SUIT data. SPACE achieves an approximate precision
of 0.788, recall 0.863 and MAP of 0.874 on the validation mock SUIT FITS
dataset. Given the manual labeling of our dataset, we perform "self-validation"
by applying statistical measures and Tamura features on the ground truth and
predicted bounding boxes. We find the distributions of entropy, contrast,
dissimilarity, and energy to show differences in the features. These
differences are qualitatively captured by the detected regions predicted by
SPACE and validated with the observed SUIT images, even in the absence of
labeled ground truth. This work not only develops a chromospheric feature
extractor but also demonstrates the effectiveness of statistical metrics and
Tamura features for distinguishing chromospheric features, offering independent
validation for future detection schemes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08265v1"><h2>Fast GPU-Powered and Auto-Differentiable Forward Modeling of IFU Data
  Cubes</h2></a>Authors:  Ufuk Çakır, Anna Lena Schaible, Tobias Buck</br>Comments: accepted to the Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop,
  NeurIPS 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>We present RUBIX, a fully tested, well-documented, and modular Open Source
tool developed in JAX, designed to forward model IFU cubes of galaxies from
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The code automatically parallelizes
computations across multiple GPUs, demonstrating performance improvements over
state-of-the-art codes by a factor of 600. This optimization reduces compute
times from hours to only seconds. RUBIX leverages JAX's auto-differentiation
capabilities to enable not only forward modeling but also gradient computations
through the entire pipeline paving the way for new methodological approaches
such as e.g. gradient-based optimization of astrophysics model parameters.
RUBIX is open-source and available on GitHub:

Chris Broekema, Rob V. van Nieuwpoort</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Currently, data-intensive scientific applications require vast amounts of
compute resources to deliver world-leading science. The climate emergency has
made it clear that unlimited use of resources (e.g., energy) for scientific
discovery is no longer acceptable. Future computing hardware promises to be
much more energy efficient, but without better optimized software this cannot
reach its full potential. In this vision paper, we propose a generic AI-driven
co-design methodology, using specialized Large Language Models (like ChatGPT),
to effectively generate efficient code for emerging computing hardware. We
describe how we will validate our methodology with two radio astronomy
applications, with sustainability as the key performance indicator. This paper
is a modified version of our accepted SuperCode project proposal. We present it
here in this form to introduce the vision behind this project and to
disseminate the work in the spirit of Open Science and transparency. An
additional aim is to collect feedback, invite potential collaboration partners
and use-cases to join the project.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06412v1"><h2>StarWhisper Telescope: Agent-Based Observation Assistant System to
  Approach AI Astrophysicist</h2></a>Authors:  Cunshi Wang, Xinjie Hu, Yu Zhang, Xunhao Chen, Pengliang Du, Yiming Mao, Rui Wang, Yuyang Li, Ying Wu, Hang Yang, Yansong Li, Beichuan Wang, Haiyang Mu, Zheng Wang, Jianfeng Tian, Liang Ge, Yongna Mao, Shengming Li, Xiaomeng Lu, Jinhang Zou, Yang Huang, Ningchen Sun, Jie Zheng, Min He, Yu Bai, Junjie Jin, Hong Wu, Chaohui Shang, Jifeng Liu</br>Comments: 21 pages, 18 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.CL</br><p>With the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents
have introduced convenient and user-friendly methods for leveraging tools
across various domains. In the field of astronomical observation, the
construction of new telescopes has significantly increased astronomers'
workload. Deploying LLM-powered agents can effectively alleviate this burden
and reduce the costs associated with training personnel. Within the Nearby
Galaxy Supernovae Survey (NGSS) project, which encompasses eight telescopes
across three observation sites, aiming to find the transients from the galaxies
in 50 mpc, we have developed the \textbf{StarWhisper Telescope System} to
manage the entire observation process. This system automates tasks such as
generating observation lists, conducting observations, analyzing data, and
providing feedback to the observer. Observation lists are customized for
different sites and strategies to ensure comprehensive coverage of celestial
objects. After manual verification, these lists are uploaded to the telescopes
via the agents in the system, which initiates observations upon neutral
language. The observed images are analyzed in real-time, and the transients are
promptly communicated to the observer. The agent modifies them into a real-time
follow-up observation proposal and send to the Xinglong observatory group chat,
then add them to the next-day observation lists. Additionally, the integration
of AI agents within the system provides online accessibility, saving
astronomers' time and encouraging greater participation from amateur
astronomers in the NGSS project.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07836v1"><h2>AI-driven Conservative-to-Primitive Conversion in Hybrid Piecewise
  Polytropic and Tabulated Equations of State</h2></a>Authors:  Semih Kacmaz, Roland Haas, E. A. Huerta</br>Comments: 10 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, physics.comp-ph, J.2; I.2</br><p>We present a novel AI-based approach to accelerate conservative-to-primitive
inversion in relativistic hydrodynamics simulations, focusing on hybrid
piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state. Traditional root-finding
methods are computationally intensive, particularly in large-scale simulations.
To address this, we employ feedforward neural networks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL),
trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU inference using NVIDIA TensorRT,
achieving significant speedups with minimal loss in accuracy. The NNC2PS model
achieves $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ errors of $4.54 \times 10^{-7}$ and $3.44 \times
10^{-6}$, respectively, with the NNC2PL model yielding even lower error values.
TensorRT optimization ensures high accuracy, with FP16 quantization offering 7x
faster performance than traditional root-finding methods. Our AI models
outperform conventional CPU solvers, demonstrating enhanced inference times,
particularly for large datasets. We release the scientific software developed
for this work, enabling the validation and extension of our findings. These
results highlight the potential of AI, combined with GPU optimization, to
significantly improve the efficiency and scalability of numerical relativity
simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08254v1"><h2>PADÉ FILTERING, Principles and Use: an Introductory Report</h2></a>Authors:  Jean-Daniel Fournier, Mikhaël Pichot du Mézeray</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>This report aims to provide gravitational waves data analysts with an
