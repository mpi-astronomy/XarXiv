  dynamics with machine learning</h2></a>Authors:  Siddhant Agarwal, Nicola Tosi, Christian HÃ¼ttig, David S.

expensive steady-state, crucial for deriving scaling laws for thermal and
dynamical flow properties and benchmarking numerical solutions. The strong
temperature dependence of the rheology of mantle rocks causes viscosity
variations of several orders of magnitude, leading to a slow-evolving stagnant
lid where heat conduction dominates, overlying a rapidly-evolving and strongly
convecting region. Time-stepping methods, while effective for fluids with
constant viscosity, are hindered by the Courant criterion, which restricts the
time step based on the system's maximum velocity and grid size. Consequently,
achieving steady-state requires a large number of time steps due to the
disparate time scales governing the stagnant and convecting regions.
  We present a concept for accelerating mantle convection simulations using
machine learning. We generate a dataset of 128 two-dimensional simulations with
mixed basal and internal heating, and pressure- and temperature-dependent
viscosity. We train a feedforward neural network on 97 simulations to predict
steady-state temperature profiles. These can then be used to initialize
numerical time stepping methods for different simulation parameters. Compared
to typical initializations, the number of time steps required to reach
steady-state is reduced by a median factor of 3.75. The benefit of this method
lies in requiring very few simulations to train on, providing a solution with
no prediction error as we initialize a numerical method, and posing minimal
computational overhead at inference time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach and discuss the potential implications for accelerated simulations
for advancing mantle convection research.</p></br>
