  Peculiar Dwarfs Using Machine Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Tianxing Zhou, Christopher A. Theissen, S. Jean Feeser, William M. J. Best, Adam J. Burgasser, Kelle L. Cruz, Lexu Zhao</br>Comments: 35 pages, 24 figures, 9 tables, accepted for publication in The
  Astrophysical Journal</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- spectral types (SpTs) M0 and later -- play
a significant role in studying stellar and substellar processes and
demographics, reaching down to planetary-mass objects. Currently, the
classification of these sources remains heavily reliant on visual inspection of
spectral features, equivalent width measurements, or narrow-/wide-band spectral
indices. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods offer automated
approaches for spectral typing, which are becoming increasingly important as
large spectroscopic surveys such as Gaia, SDSS, and SPHEREx generate datasets
containing millions of spectra. We investigate the application of ML in
spectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\sim$ 120) near-infrared
spectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared
Telescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and
metallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as
input features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built
using Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor
(KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed
the relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and
metallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN)
classifies 95.5 $\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface
gravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the
dependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources
with SNR $\gtrsim$ 60 have $\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy. We also find that zy-band
plays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the
highest feature importance.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09689v1"><h2>Machine Learning for Exoplanet Detection: A Comparative Analysis Using
  Kepler Data</h2></a>Authors:  Reihaneh Karimi, Mahdiyar Mousavi-Sadr, Mohammad H. Zhoolideh Haghighi, Fatemeh S. Tabatabaei</br>Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, Accepted for publication in Iranian
  Journal of Astronomy and Astrophysics (IJAA)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>The discovery of exoplanets has expanded our understanding of planetary
systems and opened new avenues for astronomical research. In this study, we
present a machine learning (ML) framework for exoplanet identification using a
time-series photometric dataset from the Kepler Space Telescope, comprising
3,198 flux measurements across 5,074 stars. We investigate the performance of
four supervised classification algorithms, namely Random Forest, k-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, using a comprehensive
set of evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Area
Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC), confusion
matrices, and learning curves. Among the models, Random Forest achieves the
highest accuracy (99.8\%) and near-perfect F1-scores, demonstrating superior
generalization and robustness. KNN also performs strongly, achieving 99.3\%
accuracy, while Decision Tree demonstrates moderate performance with 97.1\%
accuracy, and Logistic Regression trails behind with the lowest accuracy and
generalization at 95.8\%. Notably, the application of the Synthetic Minority
Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) significantly improves performance across all
models by addressing class imbalance. These findings underscore the
effectiveness of ensemble-based machine learning techniques, particularly
Random Forest, in handling large volumes of photometric data for automated
exoplanet detection. This approach holds significant potential for
implementation at ground-based facilities, such as the Iranian National
Observatory (INO), where such extensive and precise datasets can further
advance exoplanet discovery and characterization efforts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10094v1"><h2>Starobinsky in Stereo: SKA-CMB Synergy in SBI</h2></a>Authors:  Benedikt Schosser, Caroline Heneka, Björn Malte Schäfer</br>Comments: 22 pages, 9 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Modern machine learning techniques can unlock the vast cosmological
information encoded in forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observations.
We show that tomographic 21 cm data from the reionisation era can yield
stringent tests of inflationary models - here illustrated with Starobinsky
$R+R^2$ inflation. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we
compare neural summaries (convolutional network and vision transformer) with a
traditional power spectrum summary and perform a fully joint SBI analysis
combining 21 cm data with data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
Forecasts based on realistic mock observations indicate that SKA alone will
achieve constraints competitive with Planck, and that the combined SKA + CMB
dataset will tighten bounds on both inflationary and $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$
parameters considerably while improving precision on key astrophysical
quantities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10827v1"><h2>Accelerating exoplanet climate modelling: A machine learning approach to
  complement 3D GCM grid simulations</h2></a>Authors:  Alexander Plaschzug, Amit Reza, Ludmila Carone, Sebastian Gernjak, Christiane Helling</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing
exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand
for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data
from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the
computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation
models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of
exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning
(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of
arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.
A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type
host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network
(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to
predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To
ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,
HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all
targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the
two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are
to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but
one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.
The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature
field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to
M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional
GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is
such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud
formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.</p></br>
