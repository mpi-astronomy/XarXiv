  Simulation-Based Inference</h2></a>Authors:  Christopher Wilson, Rachel bean</br>Comments: 28 pages, 10 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>We systematically analyze the implications of statistical noise within
numerical derivatives on simulation-based Fisher forecasts for large scale
structure surveys. Noisy numerical derivatives resulting from a finite number
of simulations, $N_{sims}$, act to bias the associated Fisher forecast such
that the resulting marginalized constraints can be significantly tighter than
the noise-free limit. We show the source of this effect can be traced to the
influence of the noise on the marginalization process. Parameters such as the
neutrino mass, $\M$, for which higher-order forward differentiation schemes are
commonly used, are more prone to noise; the predicted constraints can be akin
to those purely from a random instance of statistical noise even using
$(1\mathrm{Gpc}/h)^{3}$ simulations with $N_{sims}=500$ realizations. We
demonstrate how derivative noise can artificially reduce parameter degeneracies
and seemingly null the effects of adding nuisance parameters to the forecast,
such as HOD fitting parameters. We mathematically characterize these effects
through a full statistical analysis, and demonstrate how confidence intervals
for the true noise-free, $N_{sims} \rightarrow \infty$, Fisher constraints can
be recovered even when noise comprises a consequential component of the
measured signal. The findings and approaches developed here are important for
ensuring simulation-based analyses can be accurately used to assess upcoming
survey capabilities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07179v1"><h2>Comparative Analysis of $k$-essence and Quintessence Scalar Field
  Models: A Data Analysis Approach</h2></a>Authors:  Saddam Hussain, Sarath Nelleri, Kaushik Bhattacharya</br>Comments: 24 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>We perform a comparative analysis of quintessence and $k$-essence scalar
field models in the data analysis perspective. We study the quintessence field
with an exponential potential and the $k$-essence field with an inverse square
potential in the present work. Before delving into data analysis, we provide a
brief perspective on dynamical evolution on both of the models and obtain the
stability constraints on the model parameters. We adopt Bayesian inference
procedure to estimate the model parameters that best-fit the data. A
comprehensive analysis utilizing Observational Hubble data (OHD) and Pantheon+
compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) shows that $k$-essence model fits the
data slightly better than the quintessence model while the evidence of these
models in comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model is weak. The value of the
Hubble constant predicted by both the models is in close agreement with the
value obtained by the Planck2018 collaboration assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model.</p></br>
