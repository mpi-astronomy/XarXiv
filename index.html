  Onto Five Helium-Atmosphere White Dwarfs with $\texttt{cecilia}$</h2></a>Authors:  Mariona Badenas-Agusti, Siyi Xu, Andrew Vanderburg, Kishalay De, Patrick Dufour, Laura K. Rogers, Susana Hoyos, Simon Blouin, Javier Viaña, Amy Bonsor, Ben Zuckerman</br>Comments: 28 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables. Accepted for publication in MNRAS</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>We present the first application of the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline
$\texttt{cecilia}$ to determine the physical parameters and photospheric
composition of five metal-polluted He-atmosphere white dwarfs without
well-characterised elemental abundances. To achieve this, we perform a joint
and iterative Bayesian fit to their $\textit{SDSS}$ (R=2,000) and
$\textit{Keck/ESI}$ (R=4,500) optical spectra, covering the wavelength range
from about 3,800\r{A} to 9,000\r{A}. Our analysis measures the abundances of at
least two $-$and up to six$-$ chemical elements in their atmospheres with a
predictive accuracy similar to that of conventional WD analysis techniques
($\approx$0.20 dex). The white dwarfs with the largest number of detected heavy
elements are SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which simultaneously
exhibit O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe in their $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ spectra. For all
systems, we find that the bulk composition of their pollutants is largely
consistent with those of primitive CI chondrites to within 1-2$\sigma$. We also
find evidence of statistically significant ($>2\sigma$) oxygen excesses for
SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of
oxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical
surveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community,
$\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs,
therefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar
compositions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08410v1"><h2>Understanding molecular ratios in the carbon and oxygen poor outer Milky
  Way with interpretable machine learning</h2></a>Authors:  Gijs Vermariën, Serena Viti, Johannes Heyl, Francesco Fontani</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A Sect. 6. Interstellar and
  circumstellar matter</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Context. The outer Milky Way has a lower metallicity than our solar
neighbourhood, but still many molecules are detected in the region. Molecular
line ratios can serve as probes to better understand the chemistry and physics
in these regions. Aims. We use interpretable machine learning to study 9
different molecular ratios, helping us understand the forward connection
between the physics of these environments and the carbon and oxygen
chemistries. Methods. Using a large grid of astrochemical models generated
using UCLCHEM, we study the properties of molecular clouds of low oxygen and
carbon initial abundance. We first try to understand the line ratios using a
classical analysis. We then move on to using interpretable machine learning,
namely Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to understand the higher order
dependencies of the ratios over the entire parameter grid. Lastly we use the
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection technique (UMAP) as a reduction
method to create intuitive groupings of models. Results. We find that the
parameter space is well covered by the line ratios, allowing us to investigate
all input parameters. SHAP analysis shows that the temperature and density are
the most important features, but the carbon and oxygen abundances are important
in parts of the parameter space. Lastly, we find that we can group different
types of ratios using UMAP. Conclusions. We show the chosen ratios are mostly
sensitive to changes in the carbon initial abundance, together with the
temperature and density. Especially the CN/HCN and HNC/HCN ratio are shown to
be sensitive to the initial carbon abundance, making them excellent probes for
this parameter. Out of the ratios, only CS/SO shows a sensitivity to the oxygen
abundance.</p></br>
