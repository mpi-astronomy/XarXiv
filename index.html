  Forecasting</h2></a>Authors:  Chetraj Pandey, Anli Ji, Jinsu Hong, Rafal A. Angryk, Berkay Aydin</br>Comments: 10 Pages, 8 Figures. This manuscript is accepted to be published at
  DSAA 2024 conference. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with
  arXiv:2406.11054</br>Primary Category: cs.CV</br>All Categories: cs.CV, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>In this paper, we propose a novel loss function aimed at optimizing the
binary flare prediction problem by embedding the intrinsic ordinal flare
characteristics into the binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss function. This
modification is intended to provide the model with better guidance based on the
ordinal characteristics of the data and improve the overall performance of the
models. For our experiments, we employ a ResNet34-based model with transfer
learning to predict $\geq$M-class flares by utilizing the shape-based features
of magnetograms of active region (AR) patches spanning from $-$90$^{\circ}$ to
$+$90$^{\circ}$ of solar longitude as our input data. We use a composite skill
score (CSS) as our evaluation metric, which is calculated as the geometric mean
of the True Skill Score (TSS) and the Heidke Skill Score (HSS) to rank and
compare our models' performance. The primary contributions of this work are as
follows: (i) We introduce a novel approach to encode ordinality into a binary
loss function showing an application to solar flare prediction, (ii) We enhance
solar flare forecasting by enabling flare predictions for each AR across the
entire solar disk, without any longitudinal restrictions, and evaluate and
compare performance. (iii) Our candidate model, optimized with the proposed
loss function, shows an improvement of $\sim$7%, $\sim$4%, and $\sim$3% for AR
patches within $\pm$30$^\circ$, $\pm$60$^\circ$, and $\pm$90$^\circ$ of solar
longitude, respectively in terms of CSS, when compared with standard BCE.
Additionally, we demonstrate the ability to issue flare forecasts for ARs in
near-limb regions (regions between $\pm$60$^{\circ}$ to $\pm$90$^{\circ}$) with
a CSS=0.34 (TSS=0.50 and HSS=0.23), expanding the scope of AR-based models for
solar flare prediction. This advances the reliability of solar flare forecasts,
leading to more effective prediction capabilities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10871v1"><h2>Radio U-Net: a convolutional neural network to detect diffuse radio
  sources in galaxy clusters and beyond</h2></a>Authors:  Chiara Stuardi, Claudio Gheller, Franco Vazza, Andrea Botteon</br>Comments: Accepted by MNRAS, 16 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG</br><p>The forthcoming generation of radio telescope arrays promises significant
advancements in sensitivity and resolution, enabling the identification and
characterization of many new faint and diffuse radio sources. Conventional
manual cataloging methodologies are anticipated to be insufficient to exploit
the capabilities of new radio surveys. Radio interferometric images of diffuse
sources present a challenge for image segmentation tasks due to noise,
artifacts, and embedded radio sources. In response to these challenges, we
introduce Radio U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network based on the U-Net
architecture. Radio U-Net is designed to detect faint and extended sources in
radio surveys, such as radio halos, relics, and cosmic web filaments. Radio
U-Net was trained on synthetic radio observations built upon cosmological
simulations and then tested on a sample of galaxy clusters, where the detection
of cluster diffuse radio sources relied on customized data reduction and visual
inspection of LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data. The 83% of clusters
exhibiting diffuse radio emission were accurately identified, and the
segmentation successfully recovered the morphology of the sources even in
low-quality images. In a test sample comprising 246 galaxy clusters, we
achieved a 73% accuracy rate in distinguishing between clusters with and
without diffuse radio emission. Our results establish the applicability of
Radio U-Net to extensive radio survey datasets, probing its efficiency on
cutting-edge high-performance computing systems. This approach represents an
advancement in optimizing the exploitation of forthcoming large radio surveys
for scientific exploration.</p></br>
