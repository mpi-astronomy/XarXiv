Accepted for publication in Nuclear Physics, Section B (Manuscript ID: NPB-D-25-00997)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an</br><p>In the context of fitting cosmological models, parameter degeneracy remains a central issue. This paper critically examines traditional methods for constraining parameters and focuses on the G factor as a tool for evaluating the quality of observational data. To ensure analytical independence, two datasets--Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)--were utilized as samples for parameter fitting, supplemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. The Figure of Merit (FoM) matrix served as the final criterion for assessing fitting performance. The results show that the G factor of the CC dataset increases linearly with redshift z, whereas the G factor of the BAO dataset follows a cubic relationship. Further analysis indicates that the FoM value for datasets with high G factors is significantly higher than that for datasets with low G factors, thereby validating the G factor's effectiveness as a tool for assessing observational data quality and reducing parameter degeneracy. This suggests that the G factor may serve as a diagnostic tool and selection criterion for optimizing observational datasets in future research.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15743v1"><h2>Connecting the Dots: A Machine Learning Ready Dataset for Ionospheric Forecasting Models</h2></a>Authors:  Linnea M.

Berger, Atılım Güneş Baydin, Frank Soboczenski</br>Comments: 8 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables. Accepted as a poster presentation in the Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences workshop at NeurIPS 2025</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM</br><p>Operational forecasting of the ionosphere remains a critical space weather challenge due to sparse observations, complex coupling across geospatial layers, and a growing need for timely, accurate predictions that support Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), communications, aviation safety, as well as satellite operations. As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15004v1"><h2>IonCast: A Deep Learning Framework for Forecasting Ionospheric Dynamics</h2></a>Authors:  Halil S. Kelebek, Linnea M. Wolniewicz, Michael D. Vergalla, Simone Mestici, Giacomo Acciarini, Bala Poduval, Olga Verkhoglyadova, Madhulika Guhathakurta, Thomas E. Berger, Frank Soboczenski, Atılım Güneş Baydin</br>Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables. Accepted as a poster presentation at the Machine Learning for the Physical Sciences Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.EP</br><p>The ionosphere is a critical component of near-Earth space, shaping GNSS accuracy, high-frequency communications, and aviation operations. For these reasons, accurate forecasting and modeling of ionospheric variability has become increasingly relevant. To address this gap, we present IonCast, a suite of deep learning models that include a GraphCast-inspired model tailored for ionospheric dynamics. IonCast leverages spatiotemporal learning to forecast global Total Electron Content (TEC), integrating diverse physical drivers and observational datasets. Validating on held-out storm-time and quiet conditions highlights improved skill compared to persistence. By unifying heterogeneous data with scalable graph-based spatiotemporal learning, IonCast demonstrates how machine learning can augment physical understanding of ionospheric variability and advance operational space weather resilience.</p></br>
