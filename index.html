  sampling with Normalizing Flows</h2></a>Authors:  Eleonora Villa, Golam Mohiuddin Shaifullah, Andrea Possenti, Carmelita Carbone</br>Comments: 37 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables. Submitted to the Astronomy and
  Computing special issue HPC in Cosmology and Astrophysics</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, cs.LG</br><p>We present a detailed study of Bayesian inference workflows for pulsar timing
array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through
the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise
framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on
realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and
stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence
estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of
magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional
single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the
potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while
preserving the quality of the inference.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01959v1"><h2>Addressing prior dependence in hierarchical Bayesian modeling for PTA
  data analysis II: Noise and SGWB inference through parameter decorrelation</h2></a>Authors:  Eleonora Villa, Luigi D'Amico, Aldo Barca, Fatima Modica Bittordo, Francesco Alì, Massimo Meneghetti, Luca Naso</br>Comments: 18 pages, 7 figures. Submitted to the Astronomy and Computing special
  issue HPC in Cosmology and Astrophysics</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, cs.LG</br><p>Pulsar Timing Arrays provide a powerful framework to measure low-frequency
gravitational waves, but accuracy and robustness of the results are challenged
by complex noise processes that must be accurately modeled. Standard PTA
analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can
introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this
limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise
priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the
challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise
parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure
variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal
reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows.
We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore
the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a
minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and
SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show
that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly
and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal
reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the
correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes
involved.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27050v1"><h2>Accelerating Radiative Transfer for Planetary Atmospheres by Orders of
  Magnitude with a Transformer-Based Machine Learning Model</h2></a>Authors:  Isaac Malsky, Tiffany Kataria, Natasha E. Batalha, Matthew Graham</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Radiative transfer calculations are essential for modeling planetary
atmospheres. However, standard methods are computationally demanding and impose
accuracy-speed trade-offs. High computational costs force numerical
simplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade
the accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal
candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined
physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and
high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations.
We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer
neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of
solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric
two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the
traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x. Emulating radiative transfer
with machine learning opens up the possibility for faster and more accurate
routines within planetary atmospheric models such as GCMs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01352v1"><h2>MiniFool -- Physics-Constraint-Aware Minimizer-Based Adversarial Attacks
  in Deep Neural Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Lucie Flek, Oliver Janik, Philipp Alexander Jung, Akbar Karimi, Timo Saala, Alexander Schmidt, Matthias Schott, Philipp Soldin, Matthias Thiesmeyer, Christopher Wiebusch, Ulrich Willemsen</br>Comments: Submitted to Computing and Software for Big Science</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, hep-ex, physics.data-an, J.2; I.2.6</br><p>In this paper, we present a new algorithm, MiniFool, that implements
physics-inspired adversarial attacks for testing neural network-based
classification tasks in particle and astroparticle physics. While we initially
developed the algorithm for the search for astrophysical tau neutrinos with the
IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we apply it to further data from other science
domains, thus demonstrating its general applicability. Here, we apply the
algorithm to the well-known MNIST data set and furthermore, to Open Data data
from the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The algorithm is based on
minimizing a cost function that combines a $\chi^2$ based test-statistic with
the deviation from the desired target score. The test statistic quantifies the
probability of the perturbations applied to the data based on the experimental
uncertainties. For our studied use cases, we find that the likelihood of a
flipped classification differs for both the initially correctly and incorrectly
classified events. When testing changes of the classifications as a function of
an attack parameter that scales the experimental uncertainties, the robustness
of the network decision can be quantified. Furthermore, this allows testing the
robustness of the classification of unlabeled experimental data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27146v1"><h2>SERVIMON: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance and Real-Time Monitoring for
  Astronomical Observatories</h2></a>Authors:  Emilio Mastriani, Alessandro Costa, Federico Incardona, Kevin Munari, Sebastiano Spinello</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in IAU Symposium 397: Exploring the Universe
  with Artificial Intelligence (UniversAI 2025), Cambridge University Press.
  Editors: C. Sterken, J. Hearnshaw & D. Valls-Gabaud</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Objective: ServiMon is designed to offer a scalable and intelligent pipeline
for data collection and auditing to monitor distributed astronomical systems
such as the ASTRI Mini-Array. The system enhances quality control, predictive
maintenance, and real-time anomaly detection for telescope operations. Methods:
ServiMon integrates cloud-native technologies-including Prometheus, Grafana,
Cassandra, Kafka, and InfluxDB-for telemetry collection and processing. It
employs machine learning algorithms, notably Isolation Forest, to detect
anomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write
latency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as
time-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected
by the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time
monitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases
system resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage,
minimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally,
ServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with
observational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts
also improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management.
Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive
maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By
leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale
experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine
learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution
for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00834v1"><h2>Reconstruction of Black Hole Ringdown Signals with Data Gaps using a
  Deep-Learning Framework</h2></a>Authors:  Jing-Qi Lai, Jia-Geng Jiao, Cai-Ying Shao, Jun-Xi Shi, Yu Tian</br>Comments: 15 pages, 12 figures. Code (research prototype) available at:
  https://github.com/ljq2088/RingdownGapFilling/tree/master</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>We introduce DenoiseGapFiller (DGF), a deep-learning framework specifically
designed to reconstruct gravitational-wave ringdown signals corrupted by data
gaps and instrumental noise. DGF employs a dual-branch encoder-decoder
architecture, which is fused via mixing layers and Transformer-style blocks.
Trained end-to-end on synthetic ringdown waveforms with gaps up to 20% of the
segment length, DGF can achieve a mean waveform mismatch of 0.002. The residual
amplitudes of the Time-domain shrink by roughly an order of magnitude and the
power spectral density in the 0.01-1 Hz band is suppressed by 1-2 orders of
magnitude, restoring the peak of quasi-normal mode(QNM) in the time-frequency
representation around 0.01-0.1 Hz. The ability of the model to faithfully
reconstruct the original signals, which implies milder penalties in the
detection evidence and tighter credible regions for parameter estimation, lay a
foundation for the following scientific work.</p></br>
