component of nearly all radio telescopes. They measure the intensity of
electromagnetic radiation, converting this radiation into electrical signals. A
radiometer's primary components are an antenna and a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA),
which is the core of the ``receiver'' chain. Instrumental effects introduced by
the receiver are typically corrected or removed during calibration. However,
impedance mismatches between the antenna and receiver can introduce unwanted
signal reflections and distortions. Traditional calibration methods, such as
Dicke switching, alternate the receiver input between the antenna and a
well-characterised reference source to mitigate errors by comparison. Recent
advances in Machine Learning (ML) offer promising alternatives. Neural
networks, which are trained using known signal sources, provide a powerful
means to model and calibrate complex systems where traditional analytical
approaches struggle. These methods are especially relevant for detecting the
faint sky-averaged 21-cm signal from atomic hydrogen at high redshifts. This is
one of the main challenges in observational Cosmology today. Here, for the
first time, we introduce and test a machine learning-based calibration
framework capable of achieving the precision required for radiometric
experiments aiming to detect the 21-cm line.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16079v1"><h2>A Distribution-Free Approach to Testing Models for Angular Power Spectra</h2></a>Authors:  Sara Algeri, Xiangyu Zhang, Erik Floden, Hongru Zhao, Galin L. Jones, Vuk Mandic, Jesse Miller</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: physics.data-an</br>All Categories: physics.data-an, astro-ph.IM</br><p>A novel goodness-of-fit strategy is introduced for testing models for angular
power spectra characterized by unknown parameters. Using this strategy, it is
possible to assess the validity of such models without specifying the
distribution of the estimators of the angular power spectrum being used. This
holds under general conditions, ensuring the applicability of the method across
diverse scenarios. Moreover, the proposed solution overcomes the need for
case-by-case simulations when testing different models -- leading to notable
computational advantages.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17029v1"><h2>Fried Parameter Estimation from Single Wavefront Sensor Image with
  Artificial Neural Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Jeffrey Smith, Taisei Fujii, Jesse Craney, Charles Gretton</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Atmospheric turbulence degrades the quality of astronomical observations in
ground-based telescopes, leading to distorted and blurry images. Adaptive
Optics (AO) systems are designed to counteract these effects, using atmospheric
measurements captured by a wavefront sensor to make real-time corrections to
the incoming wavefront. The Fried parameter, r0, characterises the strength of
atmospheric turbulence and is an essential control parameter for optimising the
performance of AO systems and more recently sky profiling for Free Space
Optical (FSO) communication channels. In this paper, we develop a novel
data-driven approach, adapting machine learning methods from computer vision
for Fried parameter estimation from a single Shack-Hartmann or pyramid
wavefront sensor image. Using these data-driven methods, we present a detailed
simulation-based evaluation of our approach using the open-source COMPASS AO
simulation tool to evaluate both the Shack-Hartmann and pyramid wavefront
sensors. Our evaluation is over a range of guide star magnitudes, and realistic
noise, atmospheric and instrument conditions. Remarkably, we are able to
develop a single network-based estimator that is accurate in both open and
closed-loop AO configurations. Our method accurately estimates the Fried
parameter from a single WFS image directly from AO telemetry to a few
millimetres. Our approach is suitable for real time control, exhibiting 0.83ms
r0 inference times on retail NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU hardware, and thereby
demonstrating a compelling economic solution for use in real-time instrument
control.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.17074v1"><h2>Conditional Diffusion-Based Retrieval of Atmospheric CO2 from Earth
  Observing Spectroscopy</h2></a>Authors:  William R. Keely, Otto Lamminpää, Steffen Mauceri, Sean M. R. Crowell, Christopher W. O'Dell, Gregory R. McGarragh</br>Comments: Published as a workshop paper in "Tackling Climate Change with
  Machine Learning", ICLR 2025. https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/iclr2025/12</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM</br><p>Satellite-based estimates of greenhouse gas (GHG) properties from
observations of reflected solar spectra are integral for understanding and
monitoring complex terrestrial systems and their impact on the carbon cycle due
to their near global coverage. Known as retrieval, making GHG concentration
estimations from these observations is a non-linear Bayesian inverse problem,
which is operationally solved using a computationally expensive algorithm
called Optimal Estimation (OE), providing a Gaussian approximation to a
non-Gaussian posterior. This leads to issues in solver algorithm convergence,
and to unrealistically confident uncertainty estimates for the retrieved
quantities. Upcoming satellite missions will provide orders of magnitude more
data than the current constellation of GHG observers. Development of fast and
accurate retrieval algorithms with robust uncertainty quantification is
critical. Doing so stands to provide substantial climate impact of moving
towards the goal of near continuous real-time global monitoring of carbon
sources and sinks which is essential for policy making. To achieve this goal,
we propose a diffusion-based approach to flexibly retrieve a Gaussian or
non-Gaussian posterior, for NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 spectrometer,
while providing a substantial computational speed-up over the current
operational state-of-the-art.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15679v1"><h2>Policy-Based Radiative Transfer: Solving the $2$-Level Atom Non-LTE
  Problem using Soft Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Brandon Panos, Ivan Milic</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>We present a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach for solving the
classical 2-level atom non-LTE radiative transfer problem by framing it as a
control task in which an RL agent learns a depth-dependent source function
$S(\tau)$ that self-consistently satisfies the equation of statistical
equilibrium (SE). The agent's policy is optimized entirely via reward-based
interactions with a radiative transfer engine, without explicit knowledge of
the ground truth. This method bypasses the need for constructing approximate
lambda operators ($\Lambda^*$) common in accelerated iterative schemes.
Additionally, it requires no extensive precomputed labeled datasets to extract
a supervisory signal, and avoids backpropagating gradients through the complex
RT solver itself. Finally, we show through experiment that a simple feedforward
neural network trained greedily cannot solve for SE, possibly due to the moving
target nature of the problem. Our $\Lambda^*-\text{Free}$ method offers
potential advantages for complex scenarios (e.g., atmospheres with enhanced
velocity fields, multi-dimensional geometries, or complex microphysics) where
$\Lambda^*$ construction or solver differentiability is challenging.
Additionally, the agent can be incentivized to find more efficient policies by
manipulating the discount factor, leading to a reprioritization of immediate
rewards. If demonstrated to generalize past its training data, this RL
framework could serve as an alternative or accelerated formalism to achieve SE.
To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first application of
reinforcement learning in solar physics that directly solves for a fundamental
physical constraint.</p></br>
