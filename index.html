  Background in Pulsar Timing Arrays</h2></a>Authors:  M. Alakhras, S. M. S. Movahed</br>Comments: 29 pages, 15 figures, 1 table. Comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an, stat.CO</br><p>The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) reveals valuable
information about its origin and the Universe. The pulsar timing arrays (PTAs)
are suitable indicators for detecting SGWB within the nano-Hertz frequency
range. In this work, we propose a graph-based method implemented on the pulsar
timing residuals (PTRs) for SGWB detection and examining uncertainties of its
parameters. We construct a correlation graph with pulsars as its nodes, and
analyze the graph-based summary statistics, which include topological and
geometrical characteristics, for identifying SGWB in real and synthetic
datasets. The effect of the number of pulsars, the observation time span, and
the strength of the SGWB on the graph-based feature vector is evaluated. Our
results demonstrate that the merit feature vector for common signal detection
consists of the average clustering coefficient and the edge weight fluctuation.
The SGWB detection conducted after the observation of a common signal and then
exclusion of non-Hellings \& Downs templates is performed by the second
cumulant of edge weight for angular separation thresholds $\bar{\zeta}\gtrsim
40^{\circ}$. The lowest detectable value of SGWB strain amplitude utilizing our
graph-based measures at the current PTAs sensitivity is $A_{\rm SGWB}\gtrsim
1.2\times 10^{-15}$. Fisher forecasts confirmed that the uncertainty levels of
$\log_{10} A_{\rm SGWB}$ and spectral index reach $2.2\%$ and $28.3\%$,
respectively, at $2\sigma$ confidence interval. Evidence for an SGWB at the
$3\sigma$ level is obtained by applying our graph-based method to the NANOGrav
15-year dataset.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21446v1"><h2>Forecasting Seismic Waveforms: A Deep Learning Approach for Einstein
  Telescope</h2></a>Authors:  Waleed Esmail, Alexander Kappes, Stuart Russell, Christine Thomas</br>Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures, ICRC 2025 Proceedings</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, gr-qc</br><p>We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23901v1"><h2>Interpreting deep learning-based stellar mass estimation via causal
  analysis and mutual information decomposition</h2></a>Authors:  Wei Zhang, Qiufan Lin, Yuan-Sen Ting, Shupei Chen, Hengxin Ruan, Song Li, Yifan Wang</br>Comments: Accepted at Astronomy & Astrophysics; 23 + 12 pages; 8 + 16 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, cs.AI, cs.CV</br><p>End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are
powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the
absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the
associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the
information additional to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes
to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable
further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy
properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at
interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two
interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information
decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables
beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the
multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of
different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE),
we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for
image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep
learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more
data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations
and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22018v1"><h2>Exploring the Early Universe with Deep Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Emmanuel de Salis, Massimo De Santis, Davide Piras, Sambit K. Giri, Michele Bianco, Nicolas Cerardi, Philipp Denzel, Merve Selcuk-Simsek, Kelley M. Hess, M. Carmen Toribio, Franz Kirsten, Hatem Ghorbel</br>Comments: EPIA 2025 preprint version, 12 pages, 3 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation
of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a
cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming
Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral
hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these
first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be
challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the
hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination
and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep
learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the
hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models
to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of
cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and
efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early
Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we
demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a
$0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This
enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of
structure formation in the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21661v1"><h2>Automating Sensor Characterization with Bayesian Optimization</h2></a>Authors:  J. Cuevas-Zepeda, C. Chavez, J. Estrada, J. Noonan, B. D. Nord, N. Saffold, M. Sofo-Haro, R. Spinola e Castro, S. Trivedi</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: physics.ins-det</br>All Categories: physics.ins-det, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with
three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in
simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the
design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues
to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a
significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different
operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort
spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more
of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated
sensor calibration that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development
cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using
real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal
operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing
that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize
operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device
expert.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24134v1"><h2>ASTROCO: Self-Supervised Conformer-Style Transformers for Light-Curve
  Embeddings</h2></a>Authors:  Antony Tan, Pavlos Protopapas, Martina CÃ¡diz-Leyton, Guillermo Cabrera-Vives, Cristobal Donoso-Oliva, Ignacio Becker</br>Comments: Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning and the
  Physical Sciences (ML4PS), camera-ready version in progress</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>We present AstroCo, a Conformer-style encoder for irregular stellar light
curves. By combining attention with depthwise convolutions and gating, AstroCo
captures both global dependencies and local features. On MACHO R-band, AstroCo
outperforms Astromer v1 and v2, yielding 70 percent and 61 percent lower error
respectively and a relative macro-F1 gain of about 7 percent, while producing
embeddings that transfer effectively to few-shot classification. These results
highlight AstroCo's potential as a strong and label-efficient foundation for
time-domain astronomy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24327v1"><h2>Inferring Cosmological Parameters with Evidential Physics-Informed
  Neural Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Hai Siong Tan</br>Comments: 25 pages, 11 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, gr-qc</br><p>We examine the use of a novel variant of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to
predict cosmological parameters from recent supernovae and baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) datasets. Our machine learning framework generates
uncertainty estimates for target variables and the inferred unknown parameters
of the underlying PDE descriptions. Built upon a hybrid of the principles of
Evidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural
Networks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior
distribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent
based training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al.
2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne
Ia distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and
mutual consistency among the standard $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\Lambda_s$CDM
models. Unlike previous results arising from the standard approach of
minimizing an appropriate $\chi^2$ function, the posterior distributions for
parameters in various models trained purely on Pantheon$+$ data were found to
be largely contained within the $2\sigma$ contours of their counterparts
trained on BAO data. Their posterior medians for $h_0$ were within about
$2\sigma$ of one another, indicating that our machine learning-guided approach
provides a different measure of the Hubble tension.</p></br>
