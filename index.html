  conditions</h2></a>Authors:  Giacomo Acciarini, Francesco Biscani, Dario Izzo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, physics.space-ph</br><p>In the field of spaceflight mechanics and astrodynamics, determining eclipse
regions is a frequent and critical challenge. This determination impacts
various factors, including the acceleration induced by solar radiation
pressure, the spacecraft power input, and its thermal state all of which must
be accounted for in various phases of the mission design. This study leverages
recent advances in neural image processing to develop fully differentiable
models of eclipse regions for highly irregular celestial bodies. By utilizing
test cases involving Solar System bodies previously visited by spacecraft, such
as 433 Eros, 25143 Itokawa, 67P/Churyumov--Gerasimenko, and 101955 Bennu, we
propose and study an implicit neural architecture defining the shape of the
eclipse cone based on the Sun's direction. Employing periodic activation
functions, we achieve high precision in modeling eclipse conditions.
Furthermore, we discuss the potential applications of these differentiable
models in spaceflight mechanics computations.</p></br>
