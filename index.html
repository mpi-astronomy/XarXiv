  between astrodynamical manipulations and a machine learning approach</h2></a>Authors:  Giacomo Acciarini, Laurent Beauregard, Dario Izzo</br>Comments: Paper presented and published in the proceedings of the 29th ISSFD
  Conference, Darmstadt, Germany, 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.space-ph</br><p>Low-thrust trajectories play a crucial role in optimizing scientific output
and cost efficiency in asteroid belt missions. Unlike high-thrust transfers,
low-thrust trajectories require solving complex optimal control problems. This
complexity grows exponentially with the number of asteroids visited due to
orbital mechanics intricacies. In the literature, methods for approximating
low-thrust transfers without full optimization have been proposed, including
analytical and machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose new
analytical approximations and compare their accuracy and performance to machine
learning methods. While analytical approximations leverage orbit theory to
estimate trajectory costs, machine learning employs a more black-box approach,
utilizing neural networks to predict optimal transfers based on various
attributes. We build a dataset of about 3 million transfers, found by solving
the time and fuel optimal control problems, for different time of flights,
which we also release open-source. Comparison between the two methods on this
database reveals the superiority of machine learning, especially for longer
transfers. Despite challenges such as multi revolution transfers, both
approaches maintain accuracy within a few percent in the final mass errors, on
a database of trajectories involving numerous asteroids. This work contributes
to the efficient exploration of mission opportunities in the asteroid belt,
providing insights into the strengths and limitations of different
approximation strategies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20590v1"><h2>Class-Based Time Series Data Augmentation to Mitigate Extreme Class
  Imbalance for Solar Flare Prediction</h2></a>Authors:  Junzhi Wen, Rafal A. Angryk</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.AI</br><p>Time series data plays a crucial role across various domains, making it
valuable for decision-making and predictive modeling. Machine learning (ML) and
deep learning (DL) have shown promise in this regard, yet their performance
hinges on data quality and quantity, often constrained by data scarcity and
class imbalance, particularly for rare events like solar flares. Data
augmentation techniques offer a potential solution to address these challenges,
yet their effectiveness on multivariate time series datasets remains
underexplored. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method for
time series data named Mean Gaussian Noise (MGN). We investigate the
performance of MGN compared to eight existing basic data augmentation methods
on a multivariate time series dataset for solar flare prediction, SWAN-SF,
using a ML algorithm for time series data, TimeSeriesSVC. The results
demonstrate the efficacy of MGN and highlight its potential for improving
classification performance in scenarios with extremely imbalanced data. Our
time complexity analysis shows that MGN also has a competitive computational
cost compared to the investigated alternative methods.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20389v1"><h2>Designing an Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models in Astronomy

is imperative to understand how researchers interact with these models and how
scientific sub-communities like astronomy might benefit from them. However,
there is currently no standard for evaluating the use of LLMs in astronomy.
Therefore, we present the experimental design for an evaluation study on how
astronomy researchers interact with LLMs. We deploy a Slack chatbot that can
answer queries from users via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); these
responses are grounded in astronomy papers from arXiv. We record and anonymize
user questions and chatbot answers, user upvotes and downvotes to LLM
responses, user feedback to the LLM, and retrieved documents and similarity
scores with the query. Our data collection method will enable future dynamic
evaluations of LLM tools for astronomy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19384v1"><h2>NeuralODEs for VLEO simulations: Introducing thermoNET for Thermosphere
  Modeling</h2></a>Authors:  Dario Izzo, Giacomo Acciarini, Francesco Biscani</br>Comments: Paper presented and published in the 29th ISSFD Conference,
  Darmstadt, Germany</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.LG, physics.ao-ph, physics.space-ph</br><p>We introduce a novel neural architecture termed thermoNET, designed to
represent thermospheric density in satellite orbital propagation using a
reduced amount of differentiable computations. Due to the appearance of a
neural network on the right-hand side of the equations of motion, the resulting
satellite dynamics is governed by a NeuralODE, a neural Ordinary Differential
Equation, characterized by its fully differentiable nature, allowing the
derivation of variational equations (hence of the state transition matrix) and
facilitating its use in connection to advanced numerical techniques such as
Taylor-based numerical propagation and differential algebraic techniques.
Efficient training of the network parameters occurs through two distinct
approaches. In the first approach, the network undergoes training independently
of spacecraft dynamics, engaging in a pure regression task against ground truth
models, including JB-08 and NRLMSISE-00. In the second paradigm, network
parameters are learned based on observed dynamics, adapting through ODE
sensitivities. In both cases, the outcome is a flexible, compact model of the
thermosphere density greatly enhancing numerical propagation efficiency while
maintaining accuracy in the orbital predictions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19178v1"><h2>Model-independent cosmological inference post DESI DR1 BAO measurements</h2></a>Authors:  Purba Mukherjee, Anjan Ananda Sen</br>Comments: 5 pages, 5 sets of figures. Comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, gr-qc</br><p>In this work, we implement Gaussian process regression to reconstruct the
expansion history of the universe in a model-agnostic manner, using the
Pantheon-Plus SN-Ia compilation in combination with two different BAO
measurements (SDSS-IV and DESI DR1). In both the reconstructions, the
$\Lambda$CDM model is always included in the 95\% confidence intervals. We find
evidence that the DESI LRG data at $z_{\text{eff}} = 0.51$ is not an outlier
within our model-independent framework. We study the $\mathcal{O}m$-diagnostics
and the evolution of the total equation of state (EoS) of our universe, which
hint towards the possibility of a quintessence-like dark energy scenario with a
very slowly varying EoS, and a phantom-crossing in higher $z$. The entire
exercise is later complemented by considering two more SN-Ia compilations -
DES-5YR and Union3 - in combination with DESI BAO. Reconstruction with the DESI
BAO + DES-5YR SN data sets predicts that the $\Lambda$CDM model lies outside
the 3$\sigma$ confidence levels, whereas with DESI BAO + Union3 data, the
$\Lambda$CDM model is always included within 1$\sigma$. We also report
constraints on $H_0 r_d$ from our model-agnostic analysis, independent of the
pre-recombination physics. Our results point towards an $\approx$ 2$\sigma$
discrepancy between the DESI + Pantheon-Plus and DESI + DES-5YR data sets,
which calls for further investigation.</p></br>
