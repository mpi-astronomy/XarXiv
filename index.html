  Generative Image Priors</h2></a>Authors:  Berthy T. Feng, Katherine L. Bouman, William T. Freeman</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, eess.IV</br><p>Reconstructing images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of
M87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, depends on a
prior to impose desired image statistics. However, given the impossibility of
directly observing black holes, there is no clear choice for a prior. We
present a framework for flexibly designing a range of priors, each bringing
different biases to the image reconstruction. These priors can be weak (e.g.,
impose only basic natural-image statistics) or strong (e.g., impose assumptions
of black-hole structure). Our framework uses Bayesian inference with
score-based priors, which are data-driven priors arising from a deep generative
model that can learn complicated image distributions. Using our Bayesian
imaging approach with sophisticated data-driven priors, we can assess how
visual features and uncertainty of reconstructed images change depending on the
prior. In addition to simulated data, we image the real EHT M87* data and
discuss how recovered features are influenced by the choice of prior.</p></br>
