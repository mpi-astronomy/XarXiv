G. Wyse, Alexander S. Szalay, Yang Huang, László Dobos, Tamás Budavári, Viska Wei</br>Comments: 20 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables. Submitted to AAS journals. Comments welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Cross-survey generalization is a critical challenge in stellar spectral analysis, particularly in cases such as transferring from low- to moderate-resolution surveys. We investigate this problem using pre-trained models, focusing on simple neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), with a case study transferring from LAMOST low-resolution spectra (LRS) to DESI medium-resolution spectra (MRS). Specifically, we pre-train MLPs on either LRS or their embeddings and fine-tune them for application to DESI stellar spectra. We compare MLPs trained directly on spectra with those trained on embeddings derived from transformer-based models (self-supervised foundation models pre-trained for multiple downstream tasks). We also evaluate different fine-tuning strategies, including residual-head adapters, LoRA, and full fine-tuning. We find that MLPs pre-trained on LAMOST LRS achieve strong performance, even without fine-tuning, and that modest fine-tuning with DESI spectra further improves the results. For iron abundance, embeddings from a transformer-based model yield advantages in the metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -1.0) regime, but underperform in the metal-poor regime compared to MLPs trained directly on LRS. We also show that the optimal fine-tuning strategy depends on the specific stellar parameter under consideration. These results highlight that simple pre-trained MLPs can provide competitive cross-survey generalization, while the role of spectral foundation models for cross-survey stellar parameter estimation requires further exploration.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15780v1"><h2>Deep Learning for Point Spread Function Modeling in Cosmology</h2></a>Authors:  Dayana Andrea Henao Arbeláez, Pierre-François Léget, Andrés Alejandro Plazas Malagón</br>Comments: Published in Revista eSpectra (Observatorio Astronómico Nacional de Colombia; https://espectra.astronomiaoan.co/revista-espectra-ediciones.html). Research conducted as part of the RECA Internship Program 2025 (https://www.astroreca.org/en/internship)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an</br><p>We present the development of a data-driven, AI-based model of the Point Spread Function (PSF) that achieves higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art approach, "PSF in the Full Field-of-View'' (PIFF). PIFF is widely used in leading weak-lensing surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The PSF characterizes how a point source, such as a star, is imaged after its light traverses the atmosphere and telescope optics, effectively representing the "blurred fingerprint'' of the entire imaging system. Accurate PSF modeling is essential for weak gravitational lensing analyses, as biases in its estimation propagate directly into cosmic shear measurements -- one of the primary cosmological probes of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of large-scale structure for dark energy studies. To address the limitations of PIFF, which constructs PSF models independently for each CCD and therefore loses spatial coherence across the focal plane, we introduce a deep-learning-based framework for PSF reconstruction. In this approach, an autoencoder is trained on stellar images obtained with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) of the Subaru Telescope and combined with a Gaussian process to interpolate the PSF across the telescope's full field of view. This hybrid model captures systematic variations across the focal plane and achieves a reconstruction error of $3.4 \times 10^{-6}$ compared to PIFF's $3.7 \times 10^{-6}$, laying the foundation for integration into the LSST Science Pipelines.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15296v1"><h2>GPS constellation search for exotic physics messengers coincident with the binary neutron star merger GW170817</h2></a>Authors:  Arko P. Sen, Geoffrey Blewitt, Andrey Sarantsev, Paul Ries, Andrei Derevianko</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, physics.atom-ph, physics.data-an, physics.ins-det</br><p>The Global Positioning System (GPS) includes a continuously operating, planet-scale network of atomic clocks that, beyond navigation and time dissemination, enables precision tests of fundamental physics. Here we use GPS carrier phase archival data to perform a retrospective search for exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) that might be emitted by the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, complementing gravitational wave and electromagnetic modalitiesnin multi-messenger astronomy. Such ultra-relativistic fields would imprint a dispersive, anti-chirp signature in clock-frequency time series, delayed with respect to the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detection. We construct network-median pseudo-frequency data from eighteen Rb satellite clocks referenced to a terrestrial hydrogen maser and conduct a template-bank search spanning ELF pulse duration, arrival delay, and characteristic frequency. No statistically significant signal is observed after accounting for noise statistics and template-bank trials. We derive 95\% confidence-level lower bounds on the interaction energy scale $Λ_α$ of quadratic couplings driving variations in electromagnetic fine-structure constant. These limits improve upon existing astrophysical and gravity-test constraints across the ELF-energy range $\approx10^{-18}$--$10^{-14}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This demonstrates that mature global satellite-clock networks provide an observational capability for retrospective, multi-messenger searches for new physics using decades of archival timing data.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.15088v1"><h2>IT-DPC-SRI: A Cloud-Optimized Archive of Italian Radar Precipitation (2010-2025)</h2></a>Authors:  Gabriele Franch, Elena Tomasi, Uladzislau Azhel, Giacomo Tomezzoli, Alessandro Camilletti, Virginia Poli, Renata Pelosini, Gianfranco Vulpiani, Gabriella Scipione, Giuseppe Trotta, Matteo Angelinelli, Leif Denby, Irene Livia Kruse, Marco Cristoforetti</br>Comments: 15 pages, 7 figures</br>Primary Category: physics.ao-ph</br>All Categories: physics.ao-ph, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We present IT-DPC-SRI, the first publicly available long-term archive of Italian weather radar precipitation estimates, spanning 16 years (2010--2025). The dataset contains Surface Rainfall Intensity (SRI) observations from the Italian Civil Protection Department's national radar mosaic, harmonized into a coherent Analysis-Ready Cloud-Optimized (ARCO) Zarr datacube. The archive comprises over one million timesteps at temporal resolutions from 15 to 5 minutes, covering a $1200\times1400$ kilometer domain at 1 kilometer spatial resolution, compressed from 7TB to 51GB on disk. We address the historical fragmentation of Italian radar data - previously scattered across heterogeneous formats (OPERA BUFR, HDF5, GeoTIFF) with varying spatial domains and projections - by reprocessing the entire record into a unified store. The dataset is accessible as a static versioned snapshot on Zenodo, via cloud-native access on the ECMWF European Weather Cloud, and as a continuously updated live version on the ArcoDataHub platform. This release fills a significant gap in European radar data availability, as Italy does not participate in the EUMETNET OPERA pan-European radar composite. The dataset is released under a CC BY-SA 4.0 license.</p></br>
