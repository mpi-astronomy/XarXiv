Dévora-Pajares, F. J. Pozuelos, J. C. Suárez, M. González-Penedo, C. Dafonte</br>Comments: Submitted, Open to comments</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Context. As the number of detected transiting exoplanet candidates continues to grow, the need for robust and scalable automated tools to prioritize or validate them has become increasingly critical. Among the most promising solutions, deep learning models offer the ability to interpret complex diagnostic metrics traditionally used in the vetting process. Aims. In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives. Both the model and its data preparation tools are publicly available in the dearwatson Python package, fully open-source and integrated into the vetting engine of the SHERLOCK pipeline.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09655v1"><h2>Analysis of the TAIGA-HiSCORE Data Using the Latent Space of Autoencoders</h2></a>Authors:  Yu. Yu. Dubenskaya, S. P. Polyakov, A. P. Kryukov, A. P. Demichev, E. O. Gres, E. B. Postnikov, A. Yu. Razumov, P. A. Volchugov, D. P. Zhurov</br>Comments: 16 pages, 7 figures, Proceedings of The 9th International Conference on Deep Learning in Computational Physics, July 2-4, 2025, Moscow, Russia</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, cs.LG</br><p>The aim of extensive air shower (EAS) analysis is to reconstruct the physical parameters of the primary particle that initiated the shower. The TAIGA experiment is a hybrid detector system that combines several imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detectors (TAIGA-HiSCORE) for EAS detection. Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11044v1"><h2>In-situ environmental radiation background measurement in the second phase of CJPL</h2></a>Authors:  P. Zhang, Z. Zeng, J. Cheng, H. Ma</br>Comments: 4 pages, 2 figures, conference paper of TAUP2025</br>Primary Category: physics.ins-det</br>All Categories: physics.ins-det, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), the deepest and largest underground laboratory worldwide, provides a low radiation background environment, which is necessary to frontier scientific research, such as the experimental studies of rare-event physics. Due to the almost filled space of CJPL-I and the requirement of future physics experiments, the construction of the second phase of CJPL (CJPL-II) was started in 2020 and all finished in 2024. In this work, we report the measured results of major environmental radiation in CJPL-II, including cosmic-ray muons, radon, gamma rays, and neutrons. Results indicate that the rock overburden and the radioactive background control effectively minimize the environmental radiation background. The scientific data presented also serve as an important basis to detector background modeling for the physics experiments in CJPL-II.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.09979v1"><h2>Rediscovering the Lunar Equation of the Centre with AI Feynman via Embedded Physical Biases</h2></a>Authors:  Saumya Shah, Zi-Yu Khoo, Abel Yang, Stéphane Bressan</br>Comments: 7 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM</br><p>This work explores using the physics-inspired AI Feynman symbolic regression algorithm to automatically rediscover a fundamental equation in astronomy -- the Equation of the Centre. Through the introduction of observational and inductive biases corresponding to the physical nature of the system through data preprocessing and search space restriction, AI Feynman was successful in recovering the first-order analytical form of this equation from lunar ephemerides data. However, this manual approach highlights a key limitation in its reliance on expert-driven coordinate system selection. We therefore propose an automated preprocessing extension to find the canonical coordinate system. Results demonstrate that targeted domain knowledge embedding enables symbolic regression to rediscover physical laws, but also highlight further challenges in constraining symbolic regression to derive physics equations when leveraging domain knowledge through tailored biases.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11490v1"><h2>Intrinsic Dimension Estimation for Radio Galaxy Zoo using Diffusion Models</h2></a>Authors:  Joan Font-Quer Roset, Devina Mohan, Anna Scaife</br>Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, submitted to NeurIPS 2025 ML4PS Workshop</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>In this work, we estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets. Furthermore, we analyse how iD varies across Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes and as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While no relationship is found between FR I and FR II classes, a weak trend toward higher SNR at lower iD. Future work using the RGZ dataset could make use of the relationship between iD and energy scores to quantitatively study and improve the representations learned by various self-supervised learning algorithms.</p></br>
