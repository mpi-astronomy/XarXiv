  Equivalent Widths: An EAGLES Expansion</h2></a>Authors:  George Weaver, Robin D. Jeffries, Richard J. Jackson</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
  Society. Code available at https://github.com/robdjeff/eagles. Electronic

depletion in cool stars (3000 < Teff / K < 6500), producing estimates and
probability distributions of age from Li I 6708A equivalent width (LiEW) and
effective temperature data inputs. The model is trained on the same sample of
6200 stars from 52 open clusters, observed in the Gaia-ESO spectroscopic
survey, and used to calibrate the previously published analytical EAGLES model,
with ages 2 - 6000 Myr and -0.3 < [Fe/H] < 0.2. The additional flexibility of
the ANN provides some improvements, including better modelling of the "lithium
dip" at ages < 50 Myr and Teff ~ 3500K, and of the intrinsic dispersion in LiEW
at all ages. Poor age discrimination is still an issue at ages > 1 Gyr,
confirming that additional modelling flexibility is not sufficient to fully
represent the LiEW - age - Teff relationship, and suggesting the involvement of
further astrophysical parameters. Expansion to include such parameters -
rotation, accretion, and surface gravity - is discussed, and the use of an ANN
means these can be more easily included in future iterations, alongside more
flexible functional forms for the LiEW dispersion. Our methods and ANN model
are provided in an updated version 2.0 of the EAGLES software.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07957v1"><h2>Rapid Parameter Estimation for Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals Using
  Machine Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Bo Liang, Hong Guo, Tianyu Zhao, He wang, Herik Evangelinelis, Yuxiang Xu, Chang liu, Manjia Liang, Xiaotong Wei, Yong Yuan, Peng Xu, Minghui Du, Wei-Liang Qian, Ziren Luo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: physics.comp-ph</br>All Categories: physics.comp-ph, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) signals pose significant challenges in
gravitational wave (GW) astronomy owing to their low-frequency nature and
highly complex waveforms, which occupy a high-dimensional parameter space with
numerous variables. Given their extended inspiral timescales and low
signal-to-noise ratios, EMRI signals warrant prolonged observation periods.
Parameter estimation becomes particularly challenging due to non-local
parameter degeneracies, arising from multiple local maxima, as well as flat
regions and ridges inherent in the likelihood function. These factors lead to
exceptionally high time complexity for parameter analysis while employing
traditional matched filtering and random sampling methods. To address these
challenges, the present study applies machine learning to Bayesian posterior
estimation of EMRI signals, leveraging the recently developed flow matching
technique based on ODE neural networks. Our approach demonstrates computational
efficiency several orders of magnitude faster than the traditional Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, while preserving the unbiasedness of parameter
estimation. We show that machine learning technology has the potential to
efficiently handle the vast parameter space, involving up to seventeen
parameters, associated with EMRI signals. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this
is the first instance of applying machine learning, specifically the Continuous
Normalizing Flows (CNFs), to EMRI signal analysis. Our findings highlight the
promising potential of machine learning in EMRI waveform analysis, offering new
perspectives for the advancement of space-based GW detection and GW astronomy.</p></br>
