  physical and chemical properties of stars in astronomical spectra</h2></a>Authors:  Raúl Santoveña, Carlos Dafonte, Minia Manteiga</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG, 68T07, 85-08, 85-11</br><p>Data compression techniques focused on information preservation have become
essential in the modern era of big data. In this work, an encoder-decoder
architecture has been designed, where adversarial training, a modification of
the traditional autoencoder, is used in the context of astrophysical spectral
analysis. The goal of this proposal is to obtain an intermediate representation
of the astronomical stellar spectra, in which the contribution to the flux of a
star due to the most influential physical properties (its surface temperature
and gravity) disappears and the variance reflects only the effect of the
chemical composition over the spectrum. A scheme of deep learning is used with
the aim of unraveling in the latent space the desired parameters of the rest of
the information contained in the data. This work proposes a version of
adversarial training that makes use of a discriminator per parameter to be
disentangled, thus avoiding the exponential combination that occurs in the use
of a single discriminator, as a result of the discretization of the values to
be untangled. To test the effectiveness of the method, synthetic astronomical
data are used from the APOGEE and Gaia surveys. In conjunction with the work
presented, we also provide a disentangling framework (GANDALF) available to the
community, which allows the replication, visualization, and extension of the
method to domains of any nature.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05596v1"><h2>Machine learning-driven Anomaly Detection and Forecasting for Euclid
  Space Telescope Operations</h2></a>Authors:  Pablo Gómez, Roland D. Vavrek, Guillermo Buenadicha, John Hoar, Sandor Kruk, Jan Reerink</br>Comments: Presented at IAC 2024</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM</br><p>State-of-the-art space science missions increasingly rely on automation due
to spacecraft complexity and the costs of human oversight. The high volume of
data, including scientific and telemetry data, makes manual inspection
challenging. Machine learning offers significant potential to meet these
demands.
  The Euclid space telescope, in its survey phase since February 2024,
exemplifies this shift. Euclid's success depends on accurate monitoring and
interpretation of housekeeping telemetry and science-derived data. Thousands of
telemetry parameters, monitored as time series, may or may not impact the
quality of scientific data. These parameters have complex interdependencies,
often due to physical relationships (e.g., proximity of temperature sensors).
Optimising science operations requires careful anomaly detection and
identification of hidden parameter states. Moreover, understanding the
interactions between known anomalies and physical quantities is crucial yet
complex, as related parameters may display anomalies with varied timing and
intensity.
  We address these challenges by analysing temperature anomalies in Euclid's
telemetry from February to August 2024, focusing on eleven temperature
parameters and 35 covariates. We use a predictive XGBoost model to forecast
temperatures based on historical values, detecting anomalies as deviations from
predictions. A second XGBoost model predicts anomalies from covariates,
capturing their relationships to temperature anomalies. We identify the top
three anomalies per parameter and analyse their interactions with covariates
using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), enabling rapid, automated analysis
of complex parameter relationships.
  Our method demonstrates how machine learning can enhance telemetry
monitoring, offering scalable solutions for other missions with similar data
challenges.</p></br>
