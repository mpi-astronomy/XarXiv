  Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range</h2></a>Authors:  Sojun Ono, Kazuyuki Sugimura</br>Comments: 18 pages, 7 figures, Submitted to ApJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution
in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the
thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of
magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H,
H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic
range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate
deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly
sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10%
in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for
the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU
and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with
conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions
under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method,
where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the
predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation
timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the
timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even
with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time.
This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based
chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15899v1"><h2>CIGaRS I: Combined simulation-based inference from SNae Ia and host
  photometry</h2></a>Authors:  Konstantin Karchev, Roberto Trotta, Raul Jimenez</br>Comments: submitted to Nature Astronomy; 8 pages, 6 figures + supplementary
  material</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Using type Ia supernovae (SNae Ia) as cosmological probes requires empirical
corrections, which correlate with their host environment. We present a unified
Bayesian hierarchical model designed to infer, from purely photometric
observations, the intrinsic dependence of SN Ia brightness on progenitor
properties (metallicity & age), the delay-time distribution (DTD) that governs
their rate as a function of age, and cosmology, as well as the redshifts of all
hosts. The model incorporates physics-based prescriptions for star formation
and chemical evolution from Prospector-beta, dust extinction of both galaxy and
SN light, and observational selection effects.
  We show with simulations that intrinsic dependences on metallicity and age
have distinct observational signatures, with metallicity mimicking the
well-known step of SN Ia magnitudes across a host stellar mass of $\approx
10^{10} M_{\odot}$. We then demonstrate neural simulation-based inference of
all model parameters from mock observations of ~16 000 SNae Ia and their hosts
up to redshift 0.9. Our joint physics-based approach delivers robust and
precise photometric redshifts (<0.01 median scatter) and improved cosmological
constraints, unlocking the full power of photometric data and paving the way
for an end-to-end simulation-based analysis pipeline in the LSST era.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15106v1"><h2>Enhanced Predictive Modeling for Hazardous Near-Earth Object Detection:
  A Comparative Analysis of Advanced Resampling Strategies and Machine Learning
  Algorithms in Planetary Risk Assessment</h2></a>Authors:  Sunkalp Chandra</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>This study evaluates the performance of several machine learning models for
predicting hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) through a binary classification
framework, including data scaling, power transformation, and cross-validation.
Six classifiers were compared, namely Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Gradient
Boosting Classifier (GBC), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Linear Discriminant
Analysis (LDA), Logistic Regression (LR), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). RFC
and GBC performed the best, both with an impressive F2-score of 0.987 and
0.986, respectively, with very small variability. SVC followed, with a lower
but reasonable score of 0.896. LDA and LR had a moderate performance with
scores of around 0.749 and 0.748, respectively, while KNN had a poor
performance with a score of 0.691 due to difficulty in handling complex data
patterns. RFC and GBC also presented great confusion matrices with a negligible
number of false positives and false negatives, which resulted in outstanding
accuracy rates of 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. These findings highlight the
power of ensemble methods for high precision and recall and further point out
the importance of tailored model selection with regard to dataset
characteristics and chosen evaluation metrics. Future research could focus on
the optimization of hyperparameters with advanced features engineering to
further the accuracy and robustness of the model on NEO hazard predictions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16990v1"><h2>Score Matching on Large Geometric Graphs for Cosmology Generation</h2></a>Authors:  Diana-Alexandra Onutu, Yue Zhao, Joaquin Vanschoren, Vlado Menkovski</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.AI</br><p>Generative models are a promising tool to produce cosmological simulations
but face significant challenges in scalability, physical consistency, and
adherence to domain symmetries, limiting their utility as alternatives to
$N$-body simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based
generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates
gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an
informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts
in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large
geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model
successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000
halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing
diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant
computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a
generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational
clustering of structure formation, moving closer to physically realistic and
efficient simulators for the evolution of large-scale structures in the
universe.</p></br>
