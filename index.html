  Network</h2></a>Authors:  Bo Liang, Hanlin Song, Chang Liu, Tianyu Zhao, Yuxiang Xu, Zihao Xiao, Manjia Liang, Minghui Du, Wei-Liang Qian, Li-e Qiang, Peng Xu, Ziren Luo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>In this work, we propose a new flow-matching Markov chain Monte Carlo
(FM-MCMC) algorithm for estimating the orbital parameters of exoplanetary
systems, especially for those only one exoplanet is involved. Compared to
traditional methods that rely on random sampling within the Bayesian framework,
our approach first leverages flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) to
efficiently constrain the prior range of physical parameters, and then employs
MCMC to accurately infer the posterior distribution. For example, in the
orbital parameter inference of beta Pictoris b, our model achieved a
substantial speed-up while maintaining comparable accuracy-running 77.8 times
faster than Parallel Tempered MCMC (PTMCMC) and 365.4 times faster than nested
sampling. Moreover, our FM-MCMC method also attained the highest average
log-likelihood among all approaches, demonstrating its superior sampling
efficiency and accuracy. This highlights the scalability and efficiency of our
approach, making it well-suited for processing the massive datasets expected
from future exoplanet surveys. Beyond astrophysics, our methodology establishes
a versatile paradigm for synergizing deep generative models with traditional
sampling, which can be adopted to tackle complex inference problems in other
fields, such as cosmology, biomedical imaging, and particle physics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16955v1"><h2>On the use of the Derivative Approximation for Likelihoods for
  Gravitational Wave Inference</h2></a>Authors:  Josiel Mendon√ßa Soares de Souza, Miguel Quartin</br>Comments: 26 pages, 14 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, physics.data-an</br><p>Posterior inference on the more than a dozen parameters governing a
gravitational wave (GW) event is challenging. A typical MCMC analysis can take
around $100$ CPU hours, and next generation GW observatories will detect many
thousands of events. Here we present a thorough comparison of the accuracy and
computational cost of the Fisher Matrix, Derivative Approximation for
Likelihoods (DALI) and traditional MCMC methods. We find that using DALI, which
extends the traditional Fisher Matrix (FM) method to higher orders, allows for
a good approximation of the posterior with a $55$ times smaller computational
cost, and that the cost-benefit of the doublet-DALI is better than that of the
triplet-DALI. We also show that the singlet-DALI, a hybrid MCMC-Fisher method,
is much more accurate than the traditional FM and 10 times faster than the
doublet-DALI. A large effort has been invested in forecasting the science case
of different detector configurations, and the ability of making fast yet
accurate estimations of the posteriors is an important step forward. We also
introduce version \texttt{1.0} of the public \texttt{GWDALI} code, which
incorporates automatic differentiation, modern waveforms and an optimized
parameter decomposition.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.18749v1"><h2>Symbolic Emulators for Cosmology: Accelerating Cosmological Analyses
  Without Sacrificing Precision</h2></a>Authors:  Deaglan J. Bartlett, Shivam Pandey</br>Comments: 22 pages, 6 figures. Invited contribution for the Royal Society
  Philosophical Transactions A special issue "Symbolic regression in the
  physical sciences"</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, cs.NE</br><p>In cosmology, emulators play a crucial role by providing fast and accurate
predictions of complex physical models, enabling efficient exploration of
high-dimensional parameter spaces that would be computationally prohibitive
with direct numerical simulations. Symbolic emulators have emerged as promising
alternatives to numerical approaches, delivering comparable accuracy with
significantly faster evaluation times. While previous symbolic emulators were
limited to relatively narrow prior ranges, we expand these to cover the
parameter space relevant for current cosmological analyses. We introduce
approximations to hypergeometric functions used for the $\Lambda$CDM comoving
distance and linear growth factor which are accurate to better than 0.001% and
0.05%, respectively, for all redshifts and for $\Omega_{\rm m} \in [0.1, 0.5]$.
We show that integrating symbolic emulators into a Dark Energy Survey-like
$3\times2$pt analysis produces cosmological constraints consistent with those
obtained using standard numerical methods. Our symbolic emulators offer
substantial improvements in speed and memory usage, demonstrating their
practical potential for scalable, likelihood-based inference.</p></br>
