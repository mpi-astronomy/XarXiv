Dévora-Pajares, F. J. Pozuelos, J. C. Suárez, M. González-Penedo, C. Dafonte</br>Comments: Submitted, Open to comments</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Context. As the number of detected transiting exoplanet candidates continues to grow, the need for robust and scalable automated tools to prioritize or validate them has become increasingly critical. Among the most promising solutions, deep learning models offer the ability to interpret complex diagnostic metrics traditionally used in the vetting process. Aims. In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives. Both the model and its data preparation tools are publicly available in the dearwatson Python package, fully open-source and integrated into the vetting engine of the SHERLOCK pipeline.</p></br><a href=""><h2>Galactification: painting galaxies onto dark matter only simulations using a transformer-based model</h2></a>Authors:  Shivam Pandey, Christopher C. Lovell, Chirag Modi, Benjamin D. Wandelt</br>Comments: 8 pages, 4 figures. , accepted at Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Connecting the formation and evolution of galaxies to the large-scale structure is crucial for interpreting cosmological observations. While hydrodynamical simulations accurately model the correlated properties of galaxies, they are computationally prohibitive to run over volumes that match modern surveys. We address this by developing a framework to rapidly generate mock galaxy catalogs conditioned on inexpensive dark-matter-only simulations. We present a multi-modal, transformer-based model that takes 3D dark matter density and velocity fields as input, and outputs a corresponding point cloud of galaxies with their physical properties. We demonstrate that our trained model faithfully reproduces a variety of galaxy summary statistics and correctly captures their variation with changes in the underlying cosmological and astrophysical parameters, making it the first accelerated forward model to capture all the relevant galaxy properties, their full spatial distribution, and their conditional dependencies in hydrosimulations.</p></br><a href=""><h2>Emulating Radiative Transfer in Astrophysical Environments</h2></a>Authors:  Rune Rost, Lorenzo Branca, Tobias Buck</br>Comments: Accepted at the Differentiable Systems and Scientific Machine Learning workshop at EurIPS, 2025</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Radiative transfer is a fundamental process in astrophysics, essential for both interpreting observations and modeling thermal and dynamical feedback in simulations via ionizing radiation and photon pressure. However, numerically solving the underlying radiative transfer equation is computationally intensive due to the complex interaction of light with matter and the disparity between the speed of light and the typical gas velocities in astrophysical environments, making it particularly expensive to include the effects of on-the-fly radiation in hydrodynamic simulations. This motivates the development of surrogate models that can significantly accelerate radiative transfer calculations while preserving high accuracy. We present a surrogate model based on a Fourier Neural Operator architecture combined with U-Nets. Our model approximates three-dimensional, monochromatic radiative transfer in time-dependent regimes, in absorption-emission approximation, achieving speedups of more than 2 orders of magnitude while maintaining an average relative error below 3%, demonstrating our approach's potential to be integrated into state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations.</p></br>
