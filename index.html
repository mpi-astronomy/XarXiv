  orbiting around stars from its transit light curve using deep learning</h2></a>Authors:  Ushasi Bhowmick, Shivam Kumaran</br>Comments: 16 pages, 17 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Characterizing the geometry of an object orbiting around a star from its
transit light curve is a powerful tool to uncover various complex phenomena.
This problem is inherently ill-posed, since similar or identical light curves
can be produced by multiple different shapes. In this study, we investigate the
extent to which the features of a shape can be embedded in a transit light
curve. We generate a library of two-dimensional random shapes and simulate
their transit light curves with light curve simulator, Yuti. Each shape is
decomposed into a series of elliptical components expressed in the form of
Fourier coefficients that adds increasingly diminishing perturbations to an
ideal ellipse. We train deep neural networks to predict these Fourier
coefficients directly from simulated light curves. Our results demonstrate that
the neural network can successfully reconstruct the low-order ellipses, which
describe overall shape, orientation and large-scale perturbations. For higher
order ellipses the scale is successfully determined but the inference of
eccentricity and orientation is limited, demonstrating the extent of shape
information in the light curve. We explore the impact of non-convex shape
features in reconstruction, and show its dependence on shape orientation. The
level of reconstruction achieved by the neural network underscores the utility
of using light curves as a means to extract geometric information from
transiting systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14472v1"><h2>H-Alpha Anomalyzer: An Explainable Anomaly Detector for Solar H-Alpha
  Observations</h2></a>Authors:  Mahsa Khazaei, Azim Ahmadzadeh, Alexei Pevtsov, Luca Bertello, Alexander Pevtsov</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR</br><p>The plethora of space-borne and ground-based observatories has provided
astrophysicists with an unprecedented volume of data, which can only be
processed at scale using advanced computing algorithms. Consequently, ensuring
the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The
H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream,
producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we
introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha
Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined
criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly
which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding
anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released
a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and
non-anomalous cases. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model not only
outperforms existing methods but also provides explainability, enabling
qualitative evaluation by domain experts.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13573v1"><h2>Nucleation regions in the Large-Scale Structure II: Morphology and

rich superclusters, highlighting their role as transitional structures in the
large-scale structure of the Universe. Using projected and radial velocity
distributions of member galaxies, we identify cores as dense structures that,
despite being gravitationally bound, are not yet dynamically relaxed. However,
they exhibit a tendency toward virialisation, evolving in a self-similar manner
to massive galaxy clusters but on a larger scale. Morphological analysis
reveals that cores are predominantly filamentary, reflecting quasi-linear
formation processes consistent with the Zeldovich approximation. Our estimates
of the entropy confirm their intermediate dynamical state, with relaxation
levels varying across the sample. Mass estimates indicate efficient accretion
processes, concentrating matter into gravitationally bound systems. We conclude
that cores are important environments where galaxy evolution and hierarchical
assembly occur, bridging the gap between supercluster-scale structures and
virialised clusters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14016v1"><h2>Improving cosmological reach of a gravitational wave observatory using
  Deep Loop Shaping</h2></a>Authors:  Jonas Buchli, Brendan Tracey, Tomislav Andric, Christopher Wipf, Yu Him Justin Chiu, Matthias Lochbrunner, Craig Donner, Rana X. Adhikari, Jan Harms, Iain Barr, Roland Hafner, Andrea Huber, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Charlie Beattie, Joseph Betzwieser, Serkan Cabi, Jonas Degrave, Yuzhu Dong, Leslie Fritz, Anchal Gupta, Oliver Groth, Sandy Huang, Tamara Norman, Hannah Openshaw, Jameson Rollins, Greg Thornton, George Van Den Driessche, Markus Wulfmeier, Pushmeet Kohli, Martin Riedmiller, LIGO Instrument Team</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY, gr-qc</br><p>Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would
unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole
eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of
binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects
harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We
eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning
method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO
Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the
10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design
goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of
Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more
broadly instrumentation and control systems.</p></br>
