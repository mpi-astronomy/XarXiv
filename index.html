  competition</h2></a>Authors:  Rodrigo Tenorio, Michael J. Williams, Joseph Bayley, Christopher Messenger, Maggie Demkin, Walter Reade, Kaggle Competitors</br>Comments: 31 pages, 5 + 2 figures, comments welcome</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an, physics.soc-ph</br><p>We report results of a public data-analysis challenge, hosted on the open
data-science platform Kaggle, to detect simulated continuous gravitational-wave
signals. These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain
undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a
population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data
matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more
than 1,000 participants to develop realistic CW search algorithms. We describe
the top 10 approaches and discuss their applicability as a pre-processing step
compared to standard CW-search approaches. For the competition's dataset, we
find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of
magnitude at a 2% dismissal probability. Additionally, the competition drove
the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines and extended
CW-inspired statistics to other domains. We release the associated dataset,
which constitutes the first open standardized benchmark for CW detection, to
enable reproducible method comparisons and to encourage further developments
toward the first detection of these elusive signals.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06208v1"><h2>Repeating vs. Non-Repeating FRBs: A Deep Learning Approach To
  Morphological Characterization</h2></a>Authors:  Bikash Kharel, Emmanuel Fonseca, Charanjot Brar, Afrokk Khan, Lluis Mas-Ribas, Swarali Shivraj Patil, Paul Scholz, Seth Robert Siegel, David C. Stenning</br>Comments: 26 pages, 17 figures, submitted to ApJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.HE</br>All Categories: astro-ph.HE, cs.LG</br><p>We present a deep learning approach to classify fast radio bursts (FRBs)
based purely on morphology as encoded on recorded dynamic spectrum from
CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We implemented transfer learning with a pretrained
ConvNext architecture, exploiting its powerful feature extraction ability.
ConvNext was adapted to classify dedispersed dynamic spectra (which we treat as
images) of the FRBs into one of the two sub-classes, i.e., repeater and
non-repeater, based on their various temporal and spectral properties and
relation between the sub-pulse structures. Additionally, we also used
mathematical model representation of the total intensity data to interpret the
deep learning model. Upon fine-tuning the pretrained ConvNext on the FRB
spectrograms, we were able to achieve high classification metrics while
substantially reducing training time and computing power as compared to
training a deep learning model from scratch with random weights and biases
without any feature extraction ability. Importantly, our results suggest that
the morphological differences between CHIME repeating and non-repeating events
persist in Catalog 2 and the deep learning model leveraged these differences
for classification. The fine-tuned deep learning model can be used for
inference, which enables us to predict whether an FRB's morphology resembles
that of repeaters or non-repeaters. Such inferences may become increasingly
significant when trained on larger data sets that will exist in the near
future.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05724v1"><h2>Robust variational neural posterior estimation for simulation-based
  inference</h2></a>Authors:  Matthew O'Callaghan, Kaisey S. Mandel, Gerry Gilmore</br>Comments: Main text: 16 pages, 6 figures</br>Primary Category: stat.ML</br>All Categories: stat.ML, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful
simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian
inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have
demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately
represents the underlying data generative process (GDP), recent work has shown
that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses
a significant problem for their use on real-world problems, due to simulators
always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we
introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which
addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the
simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We
test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from
astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a
data-driven manner without adopting tunable hyperparameters or priors governing
the misspecification.</p></br>
