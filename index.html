the physical and rotational properties of artificial space objects such as
satellites, rocket stages, and space debris. This paper introduces the Light
Curve Dataset Creator (LCDC), a Python-based toolkit designed to facilitate the
preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning applications of light curve data.
LCDC enables seamless integration with publicly available datasets, such as the
newly introduced Mini Mega Tortora (MMT) database. Moreover, it offers data
filtering, transformation, as well as feature extraction tooling. To
demonstrate the toolkit's capabilities, we created the first standardized
dataset for rocket body classification, RoBo6, which was used to train and
evaluate several benchmark machine learning models, addressing the lack of
reproducibility and comparability in recent studies. Furthermore, the toolkit
enables advanced scientific analyses, such as surface characterization of the
Atlas 2AS Centaur and the rotational dynamics of the Delta 4 rocket body, by
streamlining data preprocessing, feature extraction, and visualization. These
use cases highlight LCDC's potential to advance space debris characterization
and promote sustainable space exploration. Additionally, they highlight the
toolkit's ability to enable AI-focused research within the space debris
community.</p></br>
