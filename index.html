  Engineering</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an, physics.space-ph</br><p>The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) is a partnership between the
European Space Agency and Switzerland with important contributions by 10
additional ESA member States. It is the first S-class mission in the ESA
Science Programme. CHEOPS has been flying on a Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit
since December 2019, collecting millions of short-exposure images in the
visible domain to study exoplanet properties. A small yet increasing fraction
of CHEOPS images show linear trails caused by resident space objects crossing
the instrument field of view. To characterize the population of satellites and
orbital debris observed by CHEOPS, all and every science images acquired over
the past 3 years have been scanned with a Hough transform algorithm to identify
the characteristic linear features that these objects cause on the images.
Thousands of trails have been detected. This statistically significant sample
shows interesting trends and features such as an increased occurrence rate over
the past years as well as the fingerprint of the Starlink constellation. The
cross-matching of individual trails with catalogued objects is underway as we
aim to measure their distance at the time of observation and deduce the
apparent magnitude of the detected objects. As space agencies and private
companies are developing new space-based surveillance and tracking activities
to catalogue and characterize the distribution of small debris, the CHEOPS
experience is timely and relevant. With the first CHEOPS mission extension
currently running until the end of 2026, and a possible second extension until
the end of 2029, the longer time coverage will make our dataset even more
valuable to the community, especially for characterizing objects with recurrent
crossings.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18054v1"><h2>Using different sources of ground truths and transfer learning to
  improve the generalization of photometric redshift estimation</h2></a>Authors:  Jonathan Soriano, Srinath Saikrishnan, Vikram Seenivasan, Bernie Boscoe, Jack Singal, Tuan Do</br>Comments: 10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Workshop
  ML4PS</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>In this work, we explore methods to improve galaxy redshift predictions by
combining different ground truths. Traditional machine learning models rely on
training sets with known spectroscopic redshifts, which are precise but only
represent a limited sample of galaxies. To make redshift models more
generalizable to the broader galaxy population, we investigate transfer
learning and directly combining ground truth redshifts derived from photometry
and spectroscopy. We use the COSMOS2020 survey to create a dataset, TransferZ,
which includes photometric redshift estimates derived from up to 35 imaging
filters using template fitting. This dataset spans a wider range of galaxy
types and colors compared to spectroscopic samples, though its redshift
estimates are less accurate. We first train a base neural network on TransferZ
and then refine it using transfer learning on a dataset of galaxies with more
precise spectroscopic redshifts (GalaxiesML). In addition, we train a neural
network on a combined dataset of TransferZ and GalaxiesML. Both methods reduce
bias by $\sim$ 5x, RMS error by $\sim$ 1.5x, and catastrophic outlier rates by
1.3x on GalaxiesML, compared to a baseline trained only on TransferZ. However,
we also find a reduction in performance for RMS and bias when evaluated on
TransferZ data. Overall, our results demonstrate these approaches can meet
cosmological requirements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18231v1"><h2>Machine learning-based classification for Single Photon Space Debris
  Light Curves</h2></a>Authors:  Nadine M. Trummer, Amit Reza, Michael A. Steindorfer, Christiane Helling</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The growing number of man-made debris in Earth's orbit poses a threat to
active satellite missions due to the risk of collision. Characterizing unknown
debris is, therefore, of high interest. Light Curves (LCs) are temporal
variations of object brightness and have been shown to contain information such
as shape, attitude, and rotational state. Since 2015, the Satellite Laser
Ranging (SLR) group of Space Research Institute (IWF) Graz has been building a
space debris LC catalogue. The LCs are captured on a Single Photon basis, which
sets them apart from CCD-based measurements. In recent years, Machine Learning
(ML) models have emerged as a viable technique for analyzing LCs. This work
aims to classify Single Photon Space Debris using the ML framework. We have
explored LC classification using k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), Random Forest
(RDF), XGBoost (XGB), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers in
order to assess the difference in performance between traditional and deep
models. Instead of performing classification on the direct LCs data, we
extracted features from the data first using an automated pipeline. We apply
our models on three tasks, which are classifying individual objects, objects
grouped into families according to origin (e.g., GLONASS satellites), and
grouping into general types (e.g., rocket bodies). We successfully classified
Space Debris LCs captured on Single Photon basis, obtaining accuracies as high
as 90.7%. Further, our experiments show that the classifiers provide better
classification accuracy with automated extracted features than other methods.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18370v1"><h2>A one-stop strategy to search for long-duration gravitational-wave
  signals</h2></a>Authors:  Rodrigo Tenorio, Joan-René Mérou, Alicia M. Sintes</br>Comments: 18 pages, 6 figures</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Blind continuous gravitational-wave (CWs) searches are a significant
computational challenge due to their long duration and weak amplitude of the
involved signals. To cope with such problem, the community has developed a
variety of data-analysis strategies which are usually tailored to specific CW
searches; this prevents their applicability across the nowadays broad landscape
of potential CW source. Also, their sensitivity is typically hard to model, and
thus usually requires a significant computing investment. We present
fasttracks, a massively-parallel engine to evaluate detection statistics for
generic CW signals using GPU computing. We demonstrate a significant increase
in computational efficiency by parallelizing the brute-force evaluation of
detection statistics without using any computational approximations. Also, we
introduce a simple and scalable post processing which allows us to formulate a
generic semi-analytic sensitivity estimate algorithm. These proposals are
tested in a minimal all-sky search in data from the third observing run of the
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. The strategies here discussed will become
increasingly relevant in the coming years as long-duration signals become a
standard observation of future ground-based and space-borne detectors.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18070v1"><h2>Large Scale Evaluation of Deep Learning-based Explainable Solar Flare
  Forecasting Models with Attribution-based Proximity Analysis</h2></a>Authors:  Temitope Adeyeha, Chetraj Pandey, Berkay Aydin</br>Comments: This is a preprint accepted at IEEE International Conference on Big
  Data 2024( IEEE BigData 2024) Conference</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.SR, cs.CV, stat.ML</br><p>Accurate and reliable predictions of solar flares are essential due to their
potentially significant impact on Earth and space-based infrastructure.
Although deep learning models have shown notable predictive capabilities in
this domain, current evaluations often focus on accuracy while neglecting
interpretability and reliability--factors that are especially critical in
operational settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel proximity-based
framework for analyzing post hoc explanations to assess the interpretability of
deep learning models for solar flare prediction. Our study compares two models
trained on full-disk line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram images to predict
$\geq$M-class solar flares within a 24-hour window. We employ the Guided
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Guided Grad-CAM) method to generate
attribution maps from these models, which we then analyze to gain insights into
their decision-making processes. To support the evaluation of explanations in
operational systems, we introduce a proximity-based metric that quantitatively
assesses the accuracy and relevance of local explanations when regions of
interest are known. Our findings indicate that the models' predictions align
with active region characteristics to varying degrees, offering valuable
insights into their behavior. This framework enhances the evaluation of model
interpretability in solar flare forecasting and supports the development of
more transparent and reliable operational systems.</p></br>
