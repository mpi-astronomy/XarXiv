  NeurIPS 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>Recently, contrastive learning (CL), a technique most prominently used in
natural language and computer vision, has been used to train informative
representation spaces for galaxy spectra and images in a self-supervised
manner. Following this idea, we implement CL for stars in the Milky Way, for
which recent astronomical surveys have produced a huge amount of heterogeneous
data. Specifically, we investigate Gaia XP coefficients and RVS spectra. Thus,
the methods presented in this work lay the foundation for aggregating the
knowledge implicitly contained in the multimodal data to enable downstream
tasks like cross-modal generation or fused stellar parameter estimation. We
find that CL results in a highly structured representation space that exhibits
explicit physical meaning. Evaluating Using this representation space to
perform cross-modal generation and stellar label regression results in
excellent performance with high-quality generated samples as well as accurate
and precise label predictions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14386v1"><h2>Investigating the Capabilities of Deep Learning for Processing and
  Interpreting One-Shot Multi-offset GPR Data: A Numerical Case Study for Lunar
  and Martian Environments</h2></a>Authors:  Iraklis Giannakis, Craig Warren, Antonios Giannopoulos, Georgios Leontidis, Yan Su, Feng Zhou, Javier Martin-Torres, Nectaria Diamanti</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: physics.geo-ph</br>All Categories: physics.geo-ph, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a mature geophysical method that has gained
increasing popularity in planetary science over the past decade. GPR has been
utilised both for Lunar and Martian missions providing pivotal information
regarding the near surface geology of Terrestrial planets. Within that context,
numerous processing pipelines have been suggested to address the unique
challenges present in planetary setups. These processing pipelines often
require manual tuning resulting to ambiguous outputs open to non-unique
interpretations. These pitfalls combined with the large number of planetary GPR
data (kilometers in magnitude), highlight the necessity for automatic,
objective and advanced processing and interpretation schemes. The current paper
investigates the potential of deep learning for interpreting and processing GPR
data. The one-shot multi-offset configuration is investigated via a coherent
numerical case study, showcasing the potential of deep learning for A)
reconstructing the dielectric distribution of the the near surface of
Terrestrial planets, and B) filling missing or bad-quality traces. Special care
was taken for the numerical data to be both realistic and challenging.
Moreover, the generated synthetic data are properly labelled and made publicly
available for training future data-driven pipelines and contributing towards
developing pre-trained foundation models for GPR.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16116v1"><h2>Multimodal Flare Forecasting with Deep Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Grégoire Francisco, Sabrina Guastavino, Teresa Barata, João Fernandes, Dario Del Moro</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.CV</br><p>Solar flare forecasting mainly relies on photospheric magnetograms and
associated physical features to predict forthcoming flares. However, it is
believed that flare initiation mechanisms often originate in the chromosphere
and the lower corona. In this study, we employ deep learning as a purely
data-driven approach to compare the predictive capabilities of chromospheric
and coronal UV and EUV emissions across different wavelengths with those of
photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms. Our findings indicate that individual
EUV wavelengths can provide discriminatory power comparable or better to that
of line-of-sight magnetograms. Moreover, we identify simple multimodal neural
network architectures that consistently outperform single-input models, showing
complementarity between the flare precursors that can be extracted from the
distinct layers of the solar atmosphere. To mitigate potential biases from
known misattributions in Active Region flare catalogs, our models are trained
and evaluated using full-disk images and a comprehensive flare event catalog at
the full-disk level. We introduce a deep-learning architecture suited for
extracting temporal features from full-disk videos.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14623v1"><h2>syren-new: Precise formulae for the linear and nonlinear matter power
  spectra with massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy</h2></a>Authors:  Ce Sui, Deaglan J. Bartlett, Shivam Pandey, Harry Desmond, Pedro G. Ferreira, Benjamin D. Wandelt</br>Comments: 18 pages, 15 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, cs.NE</br><p>Current and future large scale structure surveys aim to constrain the
neutrino mass and the equation of state of dark energy. We aim to construct
accurate and interpretable symbolic approximations to the linear and nonlinear
matter power spectra as a function of cosmological parameters in extended
$\Lambda$CDM models which contain massive neutrinos and non-constant equations
of state for dark energy. This constitutes an extension of the syren-halofit
emulators to incorporate these two effects, which we call syren-new
(SYmbolic-Regression-ENhanced power spectrum emulator with NEutrinos and
$W_0-w_a$). We also obtain a simple approximation to the derived parameter
$\sigma_8$ as a function of the cosmological parameters for these models. Our
results for the linear power spectrum are designed to emulate CLASS, whereas
for the nonlinear case we aim to match the results of EuclidEmulator2. We
compare our results to existing emulators and $N$-body simulations. Our
analytic emulators for $\sigma_8$, the linear and nonlinear power spectra
achieve root mean squared errors of 0.1%, 0.3% and 1.3%, respectively, across a
wide range of cosmological parameters, redshifts and wavenumbers. We verify
that emulator-related discrepancies are subdominant compared to observational
errors and other modelling uncertainties when computing shear power spectra for
LSST-like surveys. Our expressions have similar accuracy to existing
(numerical) emulators, but are at least an order of magnitude faster, both on a
CPU and GPU. Our work greatly improves the accuracy, speed and range of
applicability of current symbolic approximations to the linear and nonlinear
matter power spectra. We provide publicly available code for all symbolic
approximations found.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15808v1"><h2>Mean-Field Simulation-Based Inference for Cosmological Initial
  Conditions</h2></a>Authors:  Oleg Savchenko, Florian List, Guillermo Franco Abellán, Noemi Anau Montel, Christoph Weniger</br>Comments: Accepted for the NeurIPS 2024 workshop Machine Learning and the
  Physical Sciences; 5 + 4 pages, 3 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Reconstructing cosmological initial conditions (ICs) from late-time
observations is a difficult task, which relies on the use of computationally
expensive simulators alongside sophisticated statistical methods to navigate
multi-million dimensional parameter spaces. We present a simple method for
Bayesian field reconstruction based on modeling the posterior distribution of
the initial matter density field to be diagonal Gaussian in Fourier space, with
its covariance and the mean estimator being the trainable parts of the
algorithm. Training and sampling are extremely fast (training: $\sim 1 \,
\mathrm{h}$ on a GPU, sampling: $\lesssim 3 \, \mathrm{s}$ for 1000 samples at
resolution $128^3$), and our method supports industry-standard
(non-differentiable) $N$-body simulators. We verify the fidelity of the
obtained IC samples in terms of summary statistics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.14599v1"><h2>Bayesian Multi-wavelength Imaging of the LMC SN1987A with SRG/eROSITA</h2></a>Authors:  Vincent Eberle, Matteo Guardiani, Margret Westerkamp, Philipp Frank, Michael Freyberg, Mara Salvato, Torsten Enßlin</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, cs.IT, math.IT, physics.data-an</br><p>The EDR and eRASS1 data have already revealed a remarkable number of
undiscovered X-ray sources. Using Bayesian inference and generative modeling
techniques for X-ray imaging, we aim to increase the sensitivity and scientific
value of these observations by denoising, deconvolving, and decomposing the
X-ray sky. Leveraging information field theory, we can exploit the spatial and
spectral correlation structures of the different physical components of the sky
with non-parametric priors to enhance the image reconstruction. By
incorporating instrumental effects into the forward model, we develop a
comprehensive Bayesian imaging algorithm for eROSITA pointing observations.
Finally, we apply the developed algorithm to EDR data of the LMC SN1987A,
fusing data sets from observations made by five different telescope modules.
The final result is a denoised, deconvolved, and decomposed view of the LMC,
which enables the analysis of its fine-scale structures, the creation of point
source catalogues of this region, and enhanced calibration for future work.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13148v1"><h2>Learning Efficient Representations of Neutrino Telescope Events</h2></a>Authors:  Felix J. Yu, Nicholas Kamp, Carlos A. Argüelles</br>Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to ICLR 2025</br>Primary Category: hep-ex</br>All Categories: hep-ex, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Neutrino telescopes detect rare interactions of particles produced in some of
the most extreme environments in the Universe. This is accomplished by
instrumenting a cubic-kilometer volume of naturally occurring transparent
medium with light sensors. Given their substantial size and the high frequency
of background interactions, these telescopes amass an enormous quantity of
large variance, high-dimensional data. These attributes create substantial
challenges for analyzing and reconstructing interactions, particularly when
utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques. In this paper, we present a novel
approach, called om2vec, that employs transformer-based variational
autoencoders to efficiently represent neutrino telescope events by learning
compact and descriptive latent representations. We demonstrate that these
latent representations offer enhanced flexibility and improved computational
efficiency, thereby facilitating downstream tasks in data analysis.</p></br>
