  Using An AI-based Survey of Exoplanet Atmospheres</h2></a>Authors:  Reza Ashtari, Kevin B. Stevenson, David Sing, Mercedes Lopez-Morales, Munazza K. Alam, Nikolay K. Nikolov, Thomas M. Evans-Soma</br>Comments: Accepted to AJ. 14 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Producing optimized and accurate transmission spectra of exoplanets from
telescope data has traditionally been a manual and labor-intensive procedure.
Here we present the results of the first attempt to improve and standardize
this procedure using artificial intelligence (AI) based processing of light
curves and spectroscopic data from transiting exoplanets observed with the
Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument. We
implement an AI-based parameter optimizer that autonomously operates the Eureka
pipeline to produce homogeneous transmission spectra of publicly available HST
WFC3 datasets, spanning exoplanet types from hot Jupiters to sub-Neptunes.
Surveying 43 exoplanets with temperatures between 280 and 2580 Kelvin, we
confirm modeled relationships between the amplitude of the water band at 1.4um
in hot Jupiters and their equilibrium temperatures. We also identify a similar,
novel trend in Neptune/sub-Neptune atmospheres, but shifted to cooler
temperatures. Excitingly, a planet mass versus equilibrium temperature diagram
reveals a "Clear Sky Corridor," where planets between 700 and 1700 Kelvin
(depending on the mass) show stronger 1.4um H2O band measurements. This novel
trend points to metallicity as a potentially important driver of aerosol
formation. As we unveil and include these new discoveries into our
understanding of aerosol formation, we enter a thrilling future for the study
of exoplanet atmospheres. With HST sculpting this foundational understanding
for aerosol formation in various exoplanet types, ranging from Jupiters to
sub-Neptunes, we present a compelling platform for the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) to discover similar atmospheric trends for more planets across
a broader wavelength range.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06922v1"><h2>Estimating Exoplanet Mass using Machine Learning on Incomplete Datasets</h2></a>Authors:  Florian Lalande, Elizabeth Tasker, Kenji Doya</br>Comments: 30 pages, 14 figures, 1 table. Accepted for publication in the Open
  Journal of Astrophysics</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The exoplanet archive is an incredible resource of information on the
properties of discovered extrasolar planets, but statistical analysis has been
limited by the number of missing values. One of the most informative bulk
properties is planet mass, which is particularly challenging to measure with
more than 70\% of discovered planets with no measured value. We compare the
capabilities of five different machine learning algorithms that can utilize
multidimensional incomplete datasets to estimate missing properties for
imputing planet mass. The results are compared when using a partial subset of
the archive with a complete set of six planet properties, and where all planet
discoveries are leveraged in an incomplete set of six and eight planet
properties. We find that imputation results improve with more data even when
the additional data is incomplete, and allows a mass prediction for any planet
regardless of which properties are known. Our favored algorithm is the newly
developed $k$NN$\times$KDE, which can return a probability distribution for the
imputed properties. The shape of this distribution can indicate the algorithm's
level of confidence, and also inform on the underlying demographics of the
exoplanet population. We demonstrate how the distributions can be interpreted
with a series of examples for planets where the discovery was made with either
the transit method, or radial velocity method. Finally, we test the generative
capability of the $k$NN$\times$KDE to create a large synthetic population of
planets based on the archive, and identify potential categories of planets from
groups of properties in the multidimensional space. All codes are Open Source.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05571v1"><h2>A novel stacked hybrid autoencoder for imputing LISA data gaps</h2></a>Authors:  Ruiting Mao, Jeong Eun Lee, Matthew C. Edwards</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data stream will contain gaps
with missing or unusable data due to antenna repointing, orbital corrections,
instrument malfunctions, and unknown random processes. We introduce a new deep
learning model to impute data gaps in the LISA data stream. The stacked hybrid
autoencoder combines a denoising convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) with a
bi-directional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU). The DCAE is used to extract
relevant features in the corrupted data, while the BiGRU captures the temporal
dynamics of the gravitational-wave signals. We show for a massive black hole
binary signal, corrupted by data gaps of various numbers and duration, that we
yield an overlap of greater than 99.97% when the gaps do not occur in the
merging phase and greater than 99% when the gaps do occur in the merging phase.
However, if data gaps occur during merger time, we show that we get biased
astrophysical parameter estimates, highlighting the need for "protected
periods," where antenna repointing does not occur during the predicted merger
time.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06201v1"><h2>Spectral Insights and Timing Analysis of X-ray Bursts in EXO 0748-676: A
  NuSTAR Investigation</h2></a>Authors:  Nirpat Subba, Nishika Subba, Jyoti Paul, Pankaj Sharma, Monika Ghimiray</br>Comments: 11 page, 3 figure</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.HE</br>All Categories: astro-ph.HE, hep-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>This study investigates the timing and spectral characteristics of X-ray
bursts from the neutron star system EXO 0748-676 using the NuSTAR observatory's
FPMA and FPMB instruments in the 3-79 keV range. We identify Type I X-ray
bursts driven by thermonuclear explosions on the neutron star's surface,
notably a significant burst at \(X = 18,479.97\), indicating rapid energy
release, followed by a recoil burst at \(X = 19,463.97\), reflecting
stabilization. The correlation between burst timing and the neutron star's
optical period suggests modulation by its rotation and periodic accretion
dynamics. Spectral modeling reveals a photon index of \( \Gamma = 1.24 \pm
0.014 \) and a cutoff energy of \( E_C = 36.20 \pm 1.04 \; \text{keV} \),
indicating a hot corona around the neutron star. The measured flux of
approximately \( (381.17 \pm 0.014) \times 10^{-12} \; \text{erg cm}^{-2}
\text{s}^{-1} \) underscores the dynamic nature of accretion-driven systems.
Calculated luminosities derived from distance estimates range from \( (3.86 \pm
0.239) \times 10^{36} \; \text{erg/s} \) to \( (2.3 \pm 0.177) \times 10^{36}
\; \text{erg/s} \). Comparative analysis with prior observations from the
IBIS/ISGRI instrument on the INTEGRAL satellite shows variability in emission
characteristics, including softer photon indices and higher cutoff energies in
2003 and 2004. Our examination of smaller energy gaps (3-7 keV, 7-12 keV, etc.)
reveals energy-dependent behavior in burst characteristics, enhancing our
understanding of nuclear burning phases. Overall, these findings validate
models describing Type I X-ray bursts and lay the groundwork for future
investigations into similar astrophysical systems and stellar evolution
processes in extreme environments.</p></br>
