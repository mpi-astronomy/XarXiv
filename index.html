For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters. In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features.

Automating parts of this process is therefore both scientifically significant and operationally necessary to ensure fair allocation and reproducible decisions at scale. We present AstroReview, an open-source, agent-based framework that automates proposal review in three stages: (i) novelty and scientific merit, (ii) feasibility and expected yield, and (iii) meta-review and reliability verification. Task isolation and explicit reasoning traces curb hallucinations and improve transparency. Without any domain specific fine tuning, AstroReview used in our experiments only for the last stage, correctly identifies genuinely accepted proposals with an accuracy of 87%. The AstroReview in Action module replicates the review and refinement loop; with its integrated Proposal Authoring Agent, the acceptance rate of revised drafts increases by 66% after two iterations, showing that iterative feedback combined with automated meta-review and reliability verification delivers measurable quality gains. Together, these results point to a practical path toward scalable, auditable, and higher throughput proposal review for resource limited facilities.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.22399v1"><h2>Space AI: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Space to Improve Life on Earth</h2></a>Authors:  Ziyang Wang</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, physics.space-ph</br><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming domains from healthcare and agriculture to finance and industry. As progress on Earth meets growing constraints, the next frontier is outer space, where AI can enable autonomous, resilient operations under extreme uncertainty and limited human oversight. This paper introduces Space AI as a unified interdisciplinary field at the intersection of artificial intelligence and space science and technology. We consolidate historical developments and contemporary progress, and propose a systematic framework that organises Space AI into four mission contexts: 1 AI on Earth, covering intelligent mission planning, spacecraft design optimisation, simulation, and ground-based data analytics; 2 AI in Orbit, focusing on satellite and station autonomy, space robotics, on-board/near-real-time data processing, communication optimisation, and orbital safety; (3) AI in Deep Space, enabling autonomous navigation, adaptive scientific discovery, resource mapping, and long-duration human-AI collaboration under communication constraints; and 4 AI for Multi-Planetary Life, supporting in-situ resource utilisation, habitat and infrastructure construction, life-support and ecological management, and resilient interplanetary networks. Ultimately, Space AI can accelerate humanity's capability to explore and operate in space, while translating advances in sensing, robotics, optimisation, and trustworthy AI into broad societal impact on Earth.</p></br>
