  Gaussian Distributions</h2></a>Authors:  Andrew Sweet</br>Comments: 19 pages, 7 figures, Conference proceedings for ECML PKDD 2023</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.data-an</br><p>The advancement of technology has led to rampant growth in data collection
across almost every field, including astrophysics, with researchers turning to
machine learning to process and analyze this data. One prominent example of
this data in astrophysics is the atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets. In order
to help bridge the gap between machine learning and astrophysics domain
experts, the 2023 Ariel Data Challenge was hosted to predict posterior
distributions of 7 exoplanetary features. The procedure outlined in this paper
leveraged a combination of two deep learning models to address this challenge:
a Multivariate Gaussian model that generates the mean and covariance matrix of
a multivariate Gaussian distribution, and a Uniform Quantile model that
predicts quantiles for use as the upper and lower bounds of a uniform
distribution. Training of the Multivariate Gaussian model was found to be
unstable, while training of the Uniform Quantile model was stable. An ensemble
of uniform distributions was found to have competitive results during testing
(posterior score of 696.43), and when combined with a multivariate Gaussian
distribution achieved a final rank of third in the 2023 Ariel Data Challenge
(final score of 681.57).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12730v1"><h2>Predicting the energetic proton flux with a machine learning regression
  algorithm</h2></a>Authors:  Mirko Stumpo, Monica Laurenza, Simone Benella, Maria Federica Marcucci</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.space-ph</br><p>The need of real-time of monitoring and alerting systems for Space Weather
hazards has grown significantly in the last two decades. One of the most
important challenge for space mission operations and planning is the prediction
of solar proton events (SPEs). In this context, artificial intelligence and
machine learning techniques have opened a new frontier, providing a new
paradigm for statistical forecasting algorithms. The great majority of these
models aim to predict the occurrence of a SPE, i.e., they are based on the
classification approach. In this work we present a simple and efficient machine
learning regression algorithm which is able to forecast the energetic proton
flux up to 1 hour ahead by exploiting features derived from the electron flux
only. This approach could be helpful to improve monitoring systems of the
radiation risk in both deep space and near-Earth environments. The model is
very relevant for mission operations and planning, especially when flare
characteristics and source location are not available in real time, as at Mars
distance.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14297v1"><h2>AI in Space for Scientific Missions: Strategies for Minimizing
  Neural-Network Model Upload</h2></a>Authors:  Jonah Ekelund, Ricardo Vinuesa, Yuri Khotyaintsev, Pierre Henri, Gian Luca Delzanno, Stefano Markidis</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.AI</br>All Categories: cs.AI, astro-ph.IM</br><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize space
exploration by delegating several spacecraft decisions to an onboard AI instead
of relying on ground control and predefined procedures. It is likely that there
will be an AI/ML Processing Unit onboard the spacecraft running an inference
engine. The neural-network will have pre-installed parameters that can be
updated onboard by uploading, by telecommands, parameters obtained by training
on the ground. However, satellite uplinks have limited bandwidth and
transmissions can be costly. Furthermore, a mission operating with a suboptimal
neural network will miss out on valuable scientific data. Smaller networks can
thereby decrease the uplink cost, while increasing the value of the scientific
data that is downloaded. In this work, we evaluate and discuss the use of
reduced-precision and bare-minimum neural networks to reduce the time for
upload. As an example of an AI use case, we focus on the NASA's Magnetosperic
MultiScale (MMS) mission. We show how an AI onboard could be used in the
Earth's magnetosphere to classify data to selectively downlink higher value
data or to recognize a region-of-interest to trigger a burst-mode, collecting
data at a high-rate. Using a simple filtering scheme and algorithm, we show how
the start and end of a region-of-interest can be detected in on a stream of
classifications. To provide the classifications, we use an established
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to an accuracy >94%. We also show
how the network can be reduced to a single linear layer and trained to the same
accuracy as the established CNN. Thereby, reducing the overall size of the
model by up to 98.9%. We further show how each network can be reduced by up to
75% of its original size, by using lower-precision formats to represent the
network parameters, with a change in accuracy of less than 0.6 percentage
points.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13638v1"><h2>XENONnT WIMP Search: Signal & Background Modeling and Statistical

(WIMP) dark matter scattering off a xenon nucleus. In particular, XENONnT uses
a dual-phase time projection chamber with a 5.9-tonne liquid xenon target,
detecting both scintillation and ionization signals to reconstruct the energy,
position, and type of recoil. A blind search for nuclear recoil WIMPs with an
exposure of 1.1 tonne-years yielded no signal excess over background
expectations, from which competitive exclusion limits were derived on
WIMP-nucleon elastic scatter cross sections, for WIMP masses ranging from 6
GeV/$c^2$ up to the TeV/$c^2$ scale. This work details the modeling and
statistical methods employed in this search. By means of calibration data, we
model the detector response, which is then used to derive background and signal
models. The construction and validation of these models is discussed, alongside
additional purely data-driven backgrounds. We also describe the statistical
inference framework, including the definition of the likelihood function and
the construction of confidence intervals.</p></br>
