  Machine Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Bo Liang, Hong Guo, Tianyu Zhao, He wang, Herik Evangelinelis, Yuxiang Xu, Chang liu, Manjia Liang, Xiaotong Wei, Yong Yuan, Peng Xu, Minghui Du, Wei-Liang Qian, Ziren Luo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: physics.comp-ph</br>All Categories: physics.comp-ph, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) signals pose significant challenges in
gravitational wave (GW) astronomy owing to their low-frequency nature and
highly complex waveforms, which occupy a high-dimensional parameter space with
numerous variables. Given their extended inspiral timescales and low
signal-to-noise ratios, EMRI signals warrant prolonged observation periods.
Parameter estimation becomes particularly challenging due to non-local
parameter degeneracies, arising from multiple local maxima, as well as flat
regions and ridges inherent in the likelihood function. These factors lead to
exceptionally high time complexity for parameter analysis while employing
traditional matched filtering and random sampling methods. To address these
challenges, the present study applies machine learning to Bayesian posterior
estimation of EMRI signals, leveraging the recently developed flow matching
technique based on ODE neural networks. Our approach demonstrates computational
efficiency several orders of magnitude faster than the traditional Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, while preserving the unbiasedness of parameter
estimation. We show that machine learning technology has the potential to
efficiently handle the vast parameter space, involving up to seventeen
parameters, associated with EMRI signals. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this
is the first instance of applying machine learning, specifically the Continuous
Normalizing Flows (CNFs), to EMRI signal analysis. Our findings highlight the
promising potential of machine learning in EMRI waveform analysis, offering new
perspectives for the advancement of space-based GW detection and GW astronomy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.09563v1"><h2>Astrometric Binary Classification Via Artificial Neural Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Joe Smith</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in Astrophysical Journal (ApJ)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.data-an</br><p>With nearly two billion stars observed and their corresponding astrometric
parameters evaluated in the recent Gaia mission, the number of astrometric
binary candidates have risen significantly. Due to the surplus of astrometric
data, the current computational methods employed to inspect these astrometric
binary candidates are both computationally expensive and cannot be executed in
a reasonable time frame. In light of this, a machine learning (ML) technique to
automatically classify whether a set of stars belong to an astrometric binary
pair via an artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed. Using data from Gaia
DR3, the ANN was trained and tested on 1.5 million highly probable true and
visual binaries, considering the proper motions, parallaxes, and angular and
physical separations as features. The ANN achieves high classification scores,
with an accuracy of 99.3%, a precision rate of 0.988, a recall rate of 0.991,
and an AUC of 0.999, indicating that the utilized ML technique is a highly
effective method for classifying astrometric binaries. Thus, the proposed ANN
is a promising alternative to the existing methods for the classification of
astrometric binaries.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.10381v1"><h2>J-UBIK: The JAX-accelerated Universal Bayesian Imaging Kit</h2></a>Authors:  Vincent Eberle, Matteo Guardiani, Margret Westerkamp, Philipp Frank, Julian Rüstig, Julia Stadler, Torsten A. Enßlin</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an, physics.ins-det</br><p>Many advances in astronomy and astrophysics originate from accurate images of
the sky emission across multiple wavelengths. This often requires
reconstructing spatially and spectrally correlated signals detected from
multiple instruments. To facilitate the high-fidelity imaging of these signals,
we introduce the universal Bayesian imaging kit (UBIK). Specifically, we
present J-UBIK, a flexible and modular implementation leveraging the
JAX-accelerated NIFTy.re software as its backend. J-UBIK streamlines the
implementation of the key Bayesian inference components, providing for all the
necessary steps of Bayesian imaging pipelines. First, it provides adaptable
prior models for different sky realizations. Second, it includes likelihood
models tailored to specific instruments. So far, the package includes three
instruments: Chandra and eROSITA for X-ray observations, and the James Webb
Space Telescope (JWST) for the near- and mid-infrared. The aim is to expand
this set in the future. Third, these models can be integrated with various
inference and optimization schemes, such as maximum a posteriori estimation and
variational inference. Explicit demos show how to integrate the individual
modules into a full analysis pipeline. Overall, J-UBIK enables efficient
generation of high-fidelity images via Bayesian pipelines that can be tailored
to specific research objectives.</p></br>
