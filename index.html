Alfaro, Antonio D. Montero-Dorta, Jorge F. Bustillos, Dante J. Paz, Andrés N. Ruiz, Andrés Balaguera-Antolínez, Ravi K. Sheth, Facundo Rodriguez, Constanza A. Soto-Suárez</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Cosmic voids, the largest underdense regions in the Universe, provide unique laboratories for studying galaxy formation and constitute powerful probes of cosmology. Recent work has shown that individual galaxy bias (b_i), which quantifies how each galaxy traces the underlying dark matter field, exhibits a characteristic radial dependence within spherical voids, defining a void bias profile in which galaxies near void centers display systematically lower bias values. We investigate how the environmental modulation of individual galaxy bias depends on the adopted void-finding algorithm by comparing measurements across five distinct void definitions: spherical voids 'sparkling', watershed-based methods ('zobov' and 'revolver' in two modes), and free-form integrated-density voids ('popcorn'). We apply these complementary void-finding algorithms to the same galaxy sample drawn from the IllustrisTNG simulation (TNG300-1 at $z=0$) and compute individual galaxy bias profiles as a function of distance from void centers. We quantify the correlation between b_i and the membership of the void catalogs and explore how this relationship varies with the integrated underdensity threshold for density-based methods. We find that the radial gradient of individual bias within voids, generally increasing from negative values at the void centers to higher values at the boundaries, is robust across most void definitions. However, density-threshold methods preferentially select galaxies with b_i<0, while watershed methods without density constraints include substantial contamination from high-bias boundary galaxies. The correlation between negative bias and void membership is systematically strengthened as the integrated underdensity threshold becomes less restrictive, with popcorn achieving the highest purity in isolating anti-biased populations.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.08078v1"><h2>DerivKit: stable numerical derivatives bridging Fisher forecasts and MCMC</h2></a>Authors:  Nikolina Šarčević, Matthijs van der Wild, Cynthia Trendafilova</br>Comments: 9 pages, 6 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an</br><p>DerivKit is a Python package for derivative-based statistical inference. It implements stable numerical differentiation and derivative assembly utilities for Fisher-matrix forecasting and higher-order likelihood approximations in scientific applications, supporting scalar- and vector-valued models including black-box or tabulated functions where automatic differentiation is impractical or unavailable. These derivatives are used to construct Fisher forecasts, Fisher bias estimates, and non-Gaussian likelihood expansions based on the Derivative Approximation for Likelihoods (DALI). By extending derivative-based inference beyond the Gaussian approximation, DerivKit forms a practical bridge between fast Fisher forecasts and more computationally intensive sampling-based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07284v1"><h2>Imagining the Alien: Human Projections and Cognitive Limitations</h2></a>Authors:  S. G. Djorgovski</br>Comments: 11 pages, from the refereed proceedings of the Inspiration of Astronomical Phenomena XII (INSAP XII) conference held in Corfu, Greece, May 2024, eds. N. Campion, J. Hatch, H. Henry, C. Impey and V. Shrimplin</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, physics.pop-ph</br><p>Imagining what life on other planets, and intelligent life in particular, may be like is a long-running theme in human culture. It is a manifestation of the innate human curiosity about the Cosmos, and it has inspired numerous works of art and folklore, including whole literary and other media genres. It is a profound question, with philosophical and existential implications. There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind. Interestingly, we did create what is effectively an alien intelligence on this planet in the form of now rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI). As its capabilities grow, it may give us new insights into what extraterrestrial advanced intelligences may be like.</p></br>
