In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types. Typical models are trained with ground-truth redshifts from spectroscopy. We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband ($\sim$35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3<z<1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-$z$'s for a broader population of galaxies crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.20034v1"><h2>The Sound of Noise: Leveraging the Inductive Bias of Pre-trained Audio Transformers for Glitch Identification in LIGO</h2></a>Authors:  Suyash Deshmukh, Chayan Chatterjee, Abigail Petulante, Tabata Aira Ferreira, Karan Jani</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Transient noise artifacts, or glitches, fundamentally limit the sensitivity of gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers and can mimic true astrophysical signals, particularly the short-duration intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mergers. Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck," requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes. Our results indicate that the inductive bias from audio pre-training allows superior feature extraction compared to traditional supervised techniques, offering a robust, data-efficient pathway for discovering new, anomalous transients, and classifying complex noise artifacts in the era of next-generation detectors.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18627v1"><h2>Constraining Reionization Morphology and Source Properties with 21cm-Galaxy Cross-Correlation Surveys</h2></a>Authors:  Yannic Pietschke, Anne Hutter, Caroline Heneka</br>Comments: 12 pages, 6 figures, prepared for submission to A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an</br><p>Cross-correlations between 21cm observations and galaxy surveys provide a powerful probe of reionization by reducing foreground sensitivity while linking ionization morphology to galaxies. We quantify the constraining power of 21cm-Galaxy cross-power spectra for inferring neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\mathrm{HI}(z)$ and mean overdensity $\langle 1+δ_\mathrm{HI} \rangle(z)$, exploring dependence on field of view, redshift precision $σ_z$, and minimum halo mass $M_\mathrm{h,min}$. We employ our simulation-based inference framework EoRFlow for likelihood-free parameter estimation. Mock observations include thermal noise for 100h SKA-Low with foreground avoidance and realistic galaxy survey effects. For a fiducial survey ($\mathrm{FOV}=100\,\mathrm{deg}^2$, $σ_z=0.001$, $M_\mathrm{h,min}=10^{11}\mathrm{M}_\odot$), cross-power spectra yield unbiased constraints with posterior volumes (PV) of $\sim$10% relative to priors. Cross-power measurements reduce PV by 20-30% versus 21cm auto-power alone. With foreground avoidance, spectroscopic redshift precision is essential; photometric redshifts render cross-correlations uninformative. Notably, cross-power spectra constrain ionizing source properties, the escape fraction $f_\mathrm{esc}$ and star formation efficiency $f_*$, which remain degenerate in auto-power (PV $>$60%). Tight constraints require either deep surveys detecting faint galaxies ($M_\mathrm{h,min} \sim 10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$) with moderate foregrounds, or conservative mass limits with optimistic foreground removal (PV $<$15%). 21cm-Galaxy cross-correlations enhance morphology constraints beyond auto-power while enabling previously inaccessible source property constraints. Realizing full potential requires precise redshifts and either faint galaxy detection limits or improved 21cm foreground cleaning.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.18683v1"><h2>Learned harmonic mean estimation of the marginal likelihood for multimodal posteriors with flow matching</h2></a>Authors:  Alicja Polanska, Jason D. McEwen</br>Comments: Submitted to 44th International Workshop on Bayesian Inference and Maximum Entropy Methods in Science and Engineering</br>Primary Category: stat.ME</br>All Categories: stat.ME, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The marginal likelihood, or Bayesian evidence, is a crucial quantity for Bayesian model comparison but its computation can be challenging for complex models, even in parameters space of moderate dimension. The learned harmonic mean estimator has been shown to provide accurate and robust estimates of the marginal likelihood simply using posterior samples. It is agnostic to the sampling strategy, meaning that the samples can be obtained using any method. This enables marginal likelihood calculation and model comparison with whatever sampling is most suitable for the task. However, the internal density estimators considered previously for the learned harmonic mean can struggle with highly multimodal posteriors. In this work we introduce flow matching-based continuous normalizing flows as a powerful architecture for the internal density estimation of the learned harmonic mean. We demonstrate the ability to handle challenging multimodal posteriors, including an example in 20 parameter dimensions, showcasing the method's ability to handle complex posteriors without the need for fine-tuning or heuristic modifications to the base distribution.</p></br>
