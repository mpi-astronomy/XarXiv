  machine</h2></a>Authors:  Marco Vetrano, Tiziano Zingales, G. Massimo Palma, Salvatore Lorenzo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: quant-ph</br>All Categories: quant-ph, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The study of exoplanetary atmospheres traditionally relies on forward models
to analytically compute the spectrum of an exoplanet by fine-tuning numerous
chemical and physical parameters. However, the high-dimensionality of parameter
space often results in a significant computational overhead. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach to atmospheric retrieval leveraging on quantum
extreme learning machines (QELMs). QELMs are quantum machine learning
techniques that employ quantum systems as a black box for processing input
data. In this work, we propose a framework for extracting exoplanetary
atmospheric features using QELMs, employing an intrinsically fault-tolerant
strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices, and we demonstrate such fault
tolerance with a direct implementation on IBM Fez. The QELM architecture we
present shows the potential of quantum computing in the analysis of
astrophysical datasets and may, in the near-term future, unlock new
computational tools to implement fast, efficient, and more accurate models in
the study of exoplanetary atmospheres.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02615v1"><h2>Radio Astronomy in the Era of Vision-Language Models: Prompt Sensitivity
  and Adaptation</h2></a>Authors:  Mariia Drozdova, Erica Lastufka, Vitaliy Kinakh, Taras Holotyak, Daniel Schaerer, Slava Voloshynovskiy</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as recent Qwen and Gemini models, are
positioned as general-purpose AI systems capable of reasoning across domains.
Yet their capabilities in scientific imaging, especially on unfamiliar and
potentially previously unseen data distributions, remain poorly understood. In
this work, we assess whether generic VLMs, presumed to lack exposure to
astronomical corpora, can perform morphology-based classification of radio
galaxies using the MiraBest FR-I/FR-II dataset. We explore prompting strategies
using natural language and schematic diagrams, and, to the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to introduce visual in-context examples within
prompts in astronomy. Additionally, we evaluate lightweight supervised
adaptation via LoRA fine-tuning. Our findings reveal three trends: (i) even
prompt-based approaches can achieve good performance, suggesting that VLMs
encode useful priors for unfamiliar scientific domains; (ii) however, outputs
are highly unstable, i.e. varying sharply with superficial prompt changes such
as layout, ordering, or decoding temperature, even when semantic content is
held constant; and (iii) with just 15M trainable parameters and no
astronomy-specific pretraining, fine-tuned Qwen-VL achieves near
state-of-the-art performance (3% Error rate), rivaling domain-specific models.
These results suggest that the apparent "reasoning" of VLMs often reflects
prompt sensitivity rather than genuine inference, raising caution for their use
in scientific domains. At the same time, with minimal adaptation, generic VLMs
can rival specialized models, offering a promising but fragile tool for
scientific discovery.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02661v1"><h2>The Future of Artificial Intelligence and the Mathematical and Physical

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Mathematical and Physics Sciences (MPS),
which was held in March 2025 with the goal of understanding how the MPS domains
(Astronomy, Chemistry, Materials Research, Mathematical Sciences, and Physics)
can best capitalize on, and contribute to, the future of AI. We present here a
summary and snapshot of the MPS community's perspective, as of Spring/Summer
2025, in a rapidly developing field. The link between AI and MPS is becoming
increasingly inextricable; now is a crucial moment to strengthen the link
between AI and Science by pursuing a strategy that proactively and thoughtfully
leverages the potential of AI for scientific discovery and optimizes
opportunities to impact the development of AI by applying concepts from
fundamental science. To achieve this, we propose activities and strategic
priorities that: (1) enable AI+MPS research in both directions; (2) build up an
interdisciplinary community of AI+MPS researchers; and (3) foster education and
workforce development in AI for MPS researchers and students. We conclude with
a summary of suggested priorities for funding agencies, educational
institutions, and individual researchers to help position the MPS community to
be a leader in, and take full advantage of, the transformative potential of
AI+MPS.</p></br>
