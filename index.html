  power spectrum</h2></a>Authors:  Lukas Kammerer, Deaglan J. Bartlett, Gabriel Kronberger, Harry Desmond, Pedro G. Ferreira</br>Comments: 14 pages, 6 figures. Submitted to A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, cs.NE</br><p>Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in
our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys,
acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic
parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power
spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of
wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic
feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for
the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that
without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct
sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of
hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as
well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which
describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic
nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our
approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample
variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification
expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although
this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of
previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to
have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due
to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying
cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have
little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of
baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these
models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all
symbolic approximations found.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08306v1"><h2>AstroCompress: A benchmark dataset for multi-purpose compression of
  astronomical data</h2></a>Authors:  Tuan Truong, Rithwik Sudharsan, Yibo Yang, Peter Xiangyuan Ma, Ruihan Yang, Stephan Mandt, Joshua S. Bloom</br>Comments: ICLR 2025 conference paper. See reviews at
  https://openreview.net/forum?id=kQCHCkNk7s</br>Primary Category: cs.AI</br>All Categories: cs.AI, astro-ph.IM</br><p>The site conditions that make astronomical observatories in space and on the
ground so desirable -- cold and dark -- demand a physical remoteness that leads
to limited data transmission capabilities. Such transmission limitations
directly bottleneck the amount of data acquired and in an era of costly modern
observatories, any improvements in lossless data compression has the potential
scale to billions of dollars worth of additional science that can be
accomplished on the same instrument. Traditional lossless methods for
compressing astrophysical data are manually designed. Neural data compression,
on the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms
end-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the
unique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images.
This paper introduces AstroCompress: a neural compression challenge for
astrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with
16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based,
ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to
easily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods (three
neural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art
algorithms). Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural
compression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and
provide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific
applications. Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless
compression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression
methods in future studies.</p></br>
