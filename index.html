formulas through symbolic regression. PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by
decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an
oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into
symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined
through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large
language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real
physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A
comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision
in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five
applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers,
solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions,
near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical
formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the
experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have
successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar
activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle
of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of
near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent
mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another
independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the
relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the
Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields. The formula
obtained is consistent with the properties that physicists had previously
hypothesized it should possess.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.08905v1"><h2>Towards High Precision Mass Measurements of Two Sub-Neptunes in the
  K2-266 Planetary System Through Transit Timing</h2></a>Authors:  Ing-Guey Jiang, Li-Chin Yeh, Billy Edwards, Ming Yang, Keivan G. Stassun, Napaporn A-thano</br>Comments: 15 pages, accepted by AJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, nlin.CD, physics.data-an</br><p>Sub-Neptunes have been found to be one of the most common types of
exoplanets, yet their physical parameters and properties are poorly determined
and in need of further investigation. In order to improve the mass measurement
and parameter determination of two sub-Neptunes, K2-266 d and K2-266 e, we
present new transit observations obtained with CHaracterising ExOPlanets
Satellite (CHEOPS) and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), increasing
the baseline of transit data from a few epochs to 165 epochs for K2-266 d, and
to 121 epochs for K2-266 e. Through a two-stage fitting process, it is found
that the masses of K2-266 d and K2-266 e are 6.01$\pm$0.43 $M_\oplus$ and
7.70$\pm$0.58 $M_\oplus$, respectively. With these updated values and one order
of magnitude better precision, we confirm the planets to belong to the
population of planets that has been determined to be volatile-rich. Finally, we
present the results of dynamical simulations, showing that the system is
stable, the orbits are not chaotic, and that these two planets are close to but
not in 4:3 mean motion resonance.</p></br>
