  methods</h2></a>Authors:  Peter Vereš, Richard Cloete, Matthew J. Payne, Abraham Loeb</br>Comments: 13 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the digest2 parameters for candidates
of the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP) that were reported between
2019 and 2024. Our study proposes methods for significantly reducing the
inclusion of non-NEO objects on the NEOCP. Despite the substantial increase in
near-Earth object (NEO) discoveries in recent years, only about half of the
NEOCP candidates are ultimately confirmed as NEOs. Therefore, much observing
time is spent following up on non-NEOs. Furthermore, approximately 11% of the
candidates remain unconfirmed because the follow-up observations are
insufficient. These are nearly 600 cases per year. To reduce false positives
and minimize wasted resources on non-NEOs, we refine the posting criteria for
NEOCP based on a detailed analysis of all digest2 scores. We investigated 30
distinct digest2 parameter categories for candidates that were confirmed as
NEOs and non-NEOs. From this analysis, we derived a filtering mechanism based
on selected digest2 parameters that were able to exclude 20% of the non-NEOs
from the NEOCP while maintaining a minimal loss of true NEOs. We also
investigated the application of four machine-learning (ML) techniques, that is,
the gradient-boosting machine (GBM), the random forest (RF) classifier, the
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier, and neural networks (NN) to
classify NEOCP candidates as NEOs or non-NEOs. Based on digest2 parameters as
input, our ML models achieved a precision of approximately 95% in
distinguishing between NEOs and non-NEOs. Results. Combining the digest2
parameter filter with an ML-based classification model, we demonstrate a
significant reduction in non-NEOs on the NEOCP that exceeds 80%, while limiting
the loss of NEO discovery tracklets to 5.5%. Importantly, we show that most
follow-up tracklets of initially misclassified NEOs are later correctly
identified as NEOs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14016v1"><h2>ThermoONet -- a deep learning-based small body thermophysical network:
  applications to modelling water activity of comets</h2></a>Authors:  Shunjing Zhao, Xian Shi, Hanlun Lei</br>Comments: accepted for publication in A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Cometary activity is a compelling subject of study, with thermophysical
models playing a pivotal role in its understanding. However, traditional
numerical solutions for small body thermophysical models are computationally
intensive, posing challenges for investigations requiring high-resolution or
repetitive modeling. To address this limitation, we employed a machine learning
approach to develop ThermoONet - a neural network designed to predict the
temperature and water ice sublimation flux of comets. Performance evaluations
indicate that ThermoONet achieves a low average error in subsurface temperature
of approximately 2% relative to the numerical simulation, while reducing
computational time by nearly six orders of magnitude. We applied ThermoONet to
model the water activity of comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and
21P/Giacobini-Zinner. By successfully fitting the water production rate curves
of these comets, as obtained by the Rosetta mission and the SOHO telescope,
respectively, we demonstrate the network's effectiveness and efficiency.
Furthermore, when combined with a global optimization algorithm, ThermoONet
proves capable of retrieving the physical properties of target bodies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14877v1"><h2>A self-regulated convolutional neural network for classifying variable
  stars</h2></a>Authors:  Francisco Pérez-Galarce, Jorge Martínez-Palomera, Karim Pichara, Pablo Huijse, Márcio Catelan</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.SR</br><p>Over the last two decades, machine learning models have been widely applied
and have proven effective in classifying variable stars, particularly with the
adoption of deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks,
recurrent neural networks, and transformer models. While these models have
achieved high accuracy, they require high-quality, representative data and a
large number of labelled samples for each star type to generalise well, which
can be challenging in time-domain surveys. This challenge often leads to models
learning and reinforcing biases inherent in the training data, an issue that is
not easily detectable when validation is performed on subsamples from the same
catalogue. The problem of biases in variable star data has been largely
overlooked, and a definitive solution has yet to be established. In this paper,
we propose a new approach to improve the reliability of classifiers in variable
star classification by introducing a self-regulated training process. This
process utilises synthetic samples generated by a physics-enhanced latent space
variational autoencoder, incorporating six physical parameters from Gaia Data
Release 3. Our method features a dynamic interaction between a classifier and a
generative model, where the generative model produces ad-hoc synthetic light
curves to reduce confusion during classifier training and populate
underrepresented regions in the physical parameter space. Experiments conducted
under various scenarios demonstrate that our self-regulated training approach
outperforms traditional training methods for classifying variable stars on
biased datasets, showing statistically significant improvements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14754v1"><h2>Model-Independent Machine Learning Approach for Nanometric Axial
  Localization and Tracking</h2></a>Authors:  Andrey Alexandrov, Giovanni Acampora, Giovanni De Lellis, Antonia Di Crescenzo, Chiara Errico, Daria Morozova, Valeri Tioukov, Autilia Vittiello</br>Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</br>Primary Category: eess.IV</br>All Categories: eess.IV, astro-ph.IM, cs.CV, cs.LG, physics.ins-det</br><p>Accurately tracking particles and determining their position along the
optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when
extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning
approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial
positions from dual-focal plane images without relying on predefined models.
Our method achieves an axial localization accuracy of 40 nanometers - six times
better than traditional single-focal plane techniques. The model's simple
design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses,
including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation
protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging,
materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how
machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise
information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific
applications.</p></br>
