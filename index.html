  Graph Neural Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Nikhil Garuda, John F. Wu, Dylan Nelson, Annalisa Pillepich</br>Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted at the NeurIPS ML4PS 2024 workshop</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Galaxies grow and evolve in dark matter halos. Because dark matter is not
visible, galaxies' halo masses ($\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$) must be inferred
indirectly. We present a graph neural network (GNN) model for predicting
$\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$ from stellar mass ($\rm{M}_{*}$) in simulated galaxy
clusters using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Unlike traditional
machine learning models like random forests, our GNN captures the
information-rich substructure of galaxy clusters by using spatial and kinematic
relationships between galaxy neighbour. A GNN model trained on the TNG-Cluster
dataset and independently tested on the TNG300 simulation achieves superior
predictive performance compared to other baseline models we tested. Future work
will extend this approach to different simulations and real observational
datasets to further validate the GNN model's ability to generalise.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13402v1"><h2>Extraction of gravitational wave signals in realistic LISA data</h2></a>Authors:  Eleonora Castelli, Quentin Baghi, John G.

ESA with NASA participation. As it has recently passed the Mission Adoption
milestone, models of the instruments and noise performance are becoming more
detailed, and likewise prototype data analyses must as well. Assumptions such
as Gaussianity, Stationarity, and continuous data continuity are unrealistic,
and must be replaced with physically motivated data simulations, and data
analysis methods adapted to accommodate such likely imperfections. To this end,
the LISA Data Challenges have produced datasets featuring time-varying and
unequal constellation armlength, and measurement artifacts including data
interruptions and instrumental transients. In this work, we assess the impact
of these data artifacts on the inference of Galactic Binary and Massive Black
Hole properties. Our analysis shows that the treatment of noise transients and
gaps is necessary for effective parameter estimation. We find that
straightforward mitigation techniques can significantly suppress artifacts,
albeit leaving a non-negligible impact on aspects of the science.</p></br>
