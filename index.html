  Classification with LSST</h2></a>Authors:  Richard Cloete, Peter Vereš, Abraham Loeb</br>Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The Legacy Survey of Space and Time, to be conducted with the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory, is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Solar System
by providing an unprecedented wealth of data on various objects, including the
elusive interstellar objects (ISOs). Detecting and classifying ISOs is crucial
for studying the composition and diversity of materials from other planetary
systems. However, the rarity and brief observation windows of ISOs, coupled
with the vast quantities of data to be generated by LSST, create significant
challenges for their identification and classification. This study aims to
address these challenges by exploring the application of machine learning
algorithms to the automated classification of ISO tracklets in simulated LSST
data. We employed various machine learning algorithms, including random forests
(RFs), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), gradient boosting machines (GBMs),
and neural networks (NNs), to classify ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We
demonstrate that GBM and RF algorithms outperform SGD and NN algorithms in
accurately distinguishing ISOs from other Solar System objects. RF analysis
shows that many derived Digest2 values are more important than direct
observables in classifying ISOs from the LSST tracklets. The GBM model achieves
the highest precision, recall, and F1 score, with values of 0.9987, 0.9986, and
0.9987, respectively. These findings lay the foundation for the development of
an efficient and robust automated system for ISO discovery using LSST data,
paving the way for a deeper understanding of the materials and processes that
shape planetary systems beyond our own. The integration of our proposed machine
learning approach into the LSST data processing pipeline will optimize the
survey's potential for identifying these rare and valuable objects, enabling
timely follow-up observations and further characterization.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00758v1"><h2>3D-PDR Orion dataset and NeuralPDR: Neural Differential Equations for
  Photodissociation Regions</h2></a>Authors:  Gijs Vermariën, Serena Viti, Rahul Ravichandran, Thomas G. Bisbas</br>Comments: Accepted to NeurIPS Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences
  Workshop 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>We present a novel dataset of simulations of the photodissociation region
(PDR) in the Orion Bar and provide benchmarks of emulators for the dataset.
Numerical models of PDRs are computationally expensive since the modeling of
these changing regions requires resolving the thermal balance and chemical
composition along a line-of-sight into an interstellar cloud. This often makes
it a bottleneck for 3D simulations of these regions. In this work, we provide a
dataset of 8192 models with different initial conditions simulated with 3D-PDR.
We then benchmark different architectures, focusing on Augmented Neural
Ordinary Differential Equation (ANODE) based models (Code be found at
https://github.com/uclchem/neuralpdr). Obtaining fast and robust emulators that
can be included as preconditioners of classical codes or full emulators into 3D
simulations of PDRs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01611v1"><h2>Characterizing Jupiter's interior using machine learning reveals four
  key structures</h2></a>Authors:  Maayan Ziv, Eli Galanti, Saburo Howard, Tristan Guillot, Yohai Kaspi</br>Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The internal structure of Jupiter is constrained by the precise gravity field
measurements by NASA's Juno mission, atmospheric data from the Galileo entry
probe, and Voyager radio occultations. Not only are these observations few
compared to the possible interior setups and their multiple controlling
parameters, but they remain challenging to reconcile. As a complex,
multidimensional problem, characterizing typical structures can help simplify
the modeling process. We used NeuralCMS, a deep learning model based on the
accurate concentric Maclaurin spheroid (CMS) method, coupled with a fully
consistent wind model to efficiently explore a wide range of interior models
without prior assumptions. We then identified those consistent with the
measurements and clustered the plausible combinations of parameters controlling
the interior. We determine the plausible ranges of internal structures and the
dynamical contributions to Jupiter's gravity field. Four typical interior
structures are identified, characterized by their envelope and core properties.
This reduces the dimensionality of Jupiter's interior to only two effective
parameters. Within the reduced 2D phase space, we show that the most
observationally constrained structures fall within one of the key structures,
but they require a higher 1 bar temperature than the observed value. We provide
a robust framework for characterizing giant planet interiors with consistent
wind treatment, demonstrating that for Jupiter, wind constraints strongly
impact the gravity harmonics while the interior parameter distribution remains
largely unchanged. Importantly, we find that Jupiter's interior can be
described by two effective parameters that clearly distinguish the four
characteristic structures and conclude that atmospheric measurements may not
fully represent the entire envelope.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01150v1"><h2>Representation Learning for Time-Domain High-Energy Astrophysics:
  Discovery of Extragalactic Fast X-ray Transient XRT 200515</h2></a>Authors:  Steven Dillmann, Rafael Martínez-Galarza, Roberto Soria, Rosanne Di Stefano, Vinay L. Kashyap</br>Comments: 25 pages, submitted to Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
  Society, presented at the 2023 Conference on Machine Learning in Astronomical
  Surveys (ML-IAP/CCA-2023)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.HE</br>All Categories: astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>We present a novel representation learning method for downstream tasks such
as anomaly detection and unsupervised transient classification in high-energy
datasets. This approach enabled the discovery of a new fast X-ray transient
(FXT) in the Chandra archive, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and
the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous breakthroughs in X-ray
astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic
planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient
searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t
Maps and E-t-dt Cubes, designed to capture both temporal and spectral
information, effectively addressing the challenges posed by variable-length
event file time series in machine learning applications. Our pipeline extracts
low-dimensional, informative features from these representations using
principal component analysis or sparse autoencoders, followed by clustering in
the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within
transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbor searches around known
transients, producing a catalog of 3,539 candidates (3,427 flares and 112
dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including
an intense, hard <10 s initial burst followed by spectral softening in an ~800
s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar
flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray
burst from a faint LMXB in the LMC. Our method extends to datasets from other
observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and
upcoming missions like AXIS.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00544v1"><h2>RoBo6: Standardized MMT Light Curve Dataset for Rocket Body
  Classification</h2></a>Authors:  Daniel Kyselica, Marek Šuppa, Jiří Šilha, Roman Ďurikovič</br>Comments: 6 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables, Accepted on Machine Learning and the
  Physical Sciences Workshop, NeurIPS 2024</br>Primary Category: cs.CV</br>All Categories: cs.CV, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, eess.IV</br><p>Space debris presents a critical challenge for the sustainability of future
space missions, emphasizing the need for robust and standardized identification
methods. However, a comprehensive benchmark for rocket body classification
remains absent. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the RoBo6 dataset
for rocket body classification based on light curves. The dataset, derived from
the Mini Mega Tortora database, includes light curves for six rocket body
classes: CZ-3B, Atlas 5 Centaur, Falcon 9, H-2A, Ariane 5, and Delta 4. With
5,676 training and 1,404 test samples, it addresses data inconsistencies using
resampling, normalization, and filtering techniques. Several machine learning
models were evaluated, including CNN and transformer-based approaches, with
Astroconformer reporting the best performance. The dataset establishes a common
benchmark for future comparisons and advancements in rocket body classification
tasks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02439v1"><h2>Nature versus nurture in galaxy formation: the effect of environment on
  star formation with causal machine learning</h2></a>Authors:  Sunil Mucesh, William G. Hartley, Ciarán M. Gilligan-Lee, Ofer Lahav</br>Comments: 16 pages, 4 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, cs.LG, stat.ME, stat.ML</br><p>Understanding how galaxies form and evolve is at the heart of modern
astronomy. With the advent of large-scale surveys and simulations, remarkable
progress has been made in the last few decades. Despite this, the physical
processes behind the phenomena, and particularly their importance, remain far
from known, as correlations have primarily been established rather than the
underlying causality. We address this challenge by applying the causal
inference framework. Specifically, we tackle the fundamental open question of
whether galaxy formation and evolution depends more on nature (i.e., internal
processes) or nurture (i.e., external processes), by estimating the causal
effect of environment on star-formation rate in the IllustrisTNG simulations.
To do so, we develop a comprehensive causal model and employ cutting-edge
techniques from epidemiology to overcome the long-standing problem of
disentangling nature and nurture. We find that the causal effect is negative
and substantial, with environment suppressing the SFR by a maximal factor of
$\sim100$. While the overall effect at $z=0$ is negative, in the early
universe, environment is discovered to have a positive impact, boosting star
formation by a factor of $\sim10$ at $z\sim1$ and by even greater amounts at
higher redshifts. Furthermore, we show that: (i) nature also plays an important
role, as ignoring it underestimates the causal effect in intermediate-density
environments by a factor of $\sim2$, (ii) controlling for the stellar mass at a
snapshot in time, as is common in the literature, is not only insufficient to
disentangle nature and nurture but actually has an adverse effect, though (iii)
stellar mass is an adequate proxy of the effects of nature. Finally, this work
may prove a useful blueprint for extracting causal insights in other fields
that deal with dynamical systems with closed feedback loops, such as the
Earth's climate.</p></br>
