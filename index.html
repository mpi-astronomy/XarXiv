  Star-Planet Systems</h2></a>Authors:  Shuaishuai Guo, Jianheng Guo, KaiFan Ji, Hui Liu, Lei Xing</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>With the release of a large amount of astronomical data, an increasing number
of close-in hot Jupiters have been discovered. Calculating their evolutionary
curves using star-planet interaction models presents a challenge. To expedite
the generation of evolutionary curves for these close-in hot Jupiter systems,
we utilized tidal interaction models established on MESA to create 15,745
samples of star-planet systems and 7,500 samples of stars. Additionally, we
employed a neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP) to predict the
evolutionary curves of the systems, including stellar effective temperature,
radius, stellar rotation period, and planetary orbital period. The median
relative errors of the predicted evolutionary curves were found to be 0.15%,
0.43%, 2.61%, and 0.57%, respectively. Furthermore, the speed at which we
generate evolutionary curves exceeds that of model-generated curves by more
than four orders of magnitude. We also extracted features of planetary
migration states and utilized lightGBM to classify the samples into 6
categories for prediction. We found that by combining three types that undergo
long-term double synchronization into one label, the classifier effectively
recognized these features. Apart from systems experiencing long-term double
synchronization, the median relative errors of the predicted evolutionary
curves were all below 4%. Our work provides an efficient method to save
significant computational resources and time with minimal loss in accuracy.
This research also lays the foundation for analyzing the evolutionary
characteristics of systems under different migration states, aiding in the
understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of such systems. Finally,
to a large extent, our approach could replace the calculations of theoretical
models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14865v1"><h2>Data downlink prioritization using image classification on-board a 6U
  CubeSat</h2></a>Authors:  Keenan A. A. Chatar, Ezra Fielding, Kei Sano, Kentaro Kitamura</br>Comments: 14 pages</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Nanosatellites are proliferating as low-cost dedicated sensing systems with
lean development cycles. Kyushu Institute of Technology and collaborators have
launched a joint venture for a nanosatellite mission, VERTECS. The primary
mission is to elucidate the formation history of stars by observing the
optical-wavelength cosmic background radiation. The VERTECS satellite will be
equipped with a small-aperture telescope and a high-precision attitude control
system to capture the cosmic data for analysis on the ground. However,
nanosatellites are limited by their onboard memory resources and downlink speed
capabilities. Additionally, due to a limited number of ground stations, the
satellite mission will face issues meeting the required data budget for mission
success. To alleviate this issue, we propose an on-orbit system to autonomously
classify and then compress desirable image data for data downlink
prioritization and optimization. The system comprises a prototype Camera
Controller Board (CCB) which carries a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 which is
used for classification and compression. The system uses a lightweight
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify and determine the
desirability of captured image data. The model is designed to be lean and
robust to reduce the computational and memory load on the satellite. The model
is trained and tested on a novel star field dataset consisting of data captured
by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The dataset is meant to simulate the
expected data produced by the 6U satellite. The compression step implements
GZip, RICE or HCOMPRESS compression, which are standards for astronomical data.
Preliminary testing on the proposed CNN model results in a classification
accuracy of about 100\% on the star field dataset, with compression ratios of
3.99, 5.16 and 5.43 for GZip, RICE and HCOMPRESS that were achieved on tested
FITS image data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15819v1"><h2>Automated Mixture Analysis via Structural Evaluation</h2></a>Authors:  Zachary T. P. Fried, Brett A. McGuire</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in The Journal of Physical Chemistry A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>The determination of chemical mixture components is vital to a multitude of
scientific fields. Oftentimes spectroscopic methods are employed to decipher
the composition of these mixtures. However, the sheer density of spectral
features present in spectroscopic databases can make unambiguous assignment to
individual species challenging. Yet, components of a mixture are commonly
chemically related due to environmental processes or shared precursor
molecules. Therefore, analysis of the chemical relevance of a molecule is
important when determining which species are present in a mixture. In this
paper, we combine machine-learning molecular embedding methods with a
graph-based ranking system to determine the likelihood of a molecule being
present in a mixture based on the other known species and/or chemical priors.
By incorporating this metric in a rotational spectroscopy mixture analysis
algorithm, we demonstrate that the mixture components can be identified with
extremely high accuracy (>97%) in an efficient manner.</p></br>
