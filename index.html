  High-Dimensional Data using a Manifold-Based Approach</h2></a>Authors:  R. P. Nathan, Nikolaos Nikolaou, Ofer Lahav</br>Comments: 21 pages, 14 figures</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.CO</br><p>Unsupervised machine learning methods are well suited to searching for
anomalies at scale but can struggle with the high-dimensional representation of
many modern datasets, hence dimensionality reduction (DR) is often performed
first. In this paper we analyse unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) from the
perspective of the manifold created in DR. We present an idealised
illustration, "Finding Pegasus", and a novel formal framework with which we
categorise AD methods and their results into "on manifold" and "off manifold".
We define these terms and show how they differ. We then use this insight to
develop an approach of combining AD methods which significantly boosts AD
recall without sacrificing precision in situations employing high DR. When
tested on MNIST data, our approach of combining AD methods improves recall by
as much as 16 percent compared with simply combining with the best standalone
AD method (Isolation Forest), a result which shows great promise for its
application to real-world data.</p></br>
