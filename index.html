  Onto Five Helium-Atmosphere White Dwarfs with $\texttt{cecilia}$</h2></a>Authors:  Mariona Badenas-Agusti, Siyi Xu, Andrew Vanderburg, Kishalay De, Patrick Dufour, Laura K. Rogers, Susana Hoyos, Simon Blouin, Javier Via√±a, Amy Bonsor, Ben Zuckerman</br>Comments: 28 pages, 14 figures, 5 tables. Accepted for publication in MNRAS</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>We present the first application of the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline
$\texttt{cecilia}$ to determine the physical parameters and photospheric
composition of five metal-polluted He-atmosphere white dwarfs without
well-characterised elemental abundances. To achieve this, we perform a joint
and iterative Bayesian fit to their $\textit{SDSS}$ (R=2,000) and
$\textit{Keck/ESI}$ (R=4,500) optical spectra, covering the wavelength range
from about 3,800\r{A} to 9,000\r{A}. Our analysis measures the abundances of at
least two $-$and up to six$-$ chemical elements in their atmospheres with a
predictive accuracy similar to that of conventional WD analysis techniques
($\approx$0.20 dex). The white dwarfs with the largest number of detected heavy
elements are SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which simultaneously
exhibit O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe in their $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ spectra. For all
systems, we find that the bulk composition of their pollutants is largely
consistent with those of primitive CI chondrites to within 1-2$\sigma$. We also
find evidence of statistically significant ($>2\sigma$) oxygen excesses for
SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of
oxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical
surveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community,
$\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs,
therefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar
compositions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05310v1"><h2>A comparative analysis of GNSS-inferred precipitable water vapour at the
  potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope</h2></a>Authors:  Lott Frans, Michael Backes, Heino Falcke, Tiziana Venturi</br>Comments: 12 pages, 12 figures, article published in MNRAS</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a network of antennas across the globe
currently used to image super-massive black holes (SMBHs) at a frequency of 230
GHz. Since the release of the image of M87$^\ast$ in 2019 and, subsequently,
that of Sgr A$^\ast$ in 2022 by the EHT collaboration, the focus has shifted to
dynamically imaging SMBHs. This has led to a search for potential sites to
extend and fill in the gaps within the EHT network. The Gamsberg Mountain and
the H.E.S.S. site are both located within the Khomas highlands and have been
identified as potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope (AMT).
Precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the atmosphere is the main source of opacity
and noise from atmospheric emissions when observing at millimetre to
sub-millimetre wavelengths. This study aims to establish the PWV content and
the atmospheric transmission at 86, 230, and 345 GHz at the AMT potential sites
using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) derived PWV data. Results show
both sites have potential for observations at 86 and 230 GHz, with 345 GHz
possible at the Gamsberg Mountain during winter. The overall median PWV of
14.27 mm and 9.25 mm was calculated at the H.E.S.S. site and the Gamsberg
Mountain, respectively. The EHT window had PWV medians of 16.62 mm and 11.20 mm
at the H.E.S.S. site and Gamsberg Mountain, respectively. Among the two sites,
the Gamsberg Mountain had the lowest PWV conditions, therefore making it the
most suitable site for the AMT.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05346v1"><h2>Analysis of the accuracy of GNSS inferred precipitable water vapour
  against that from a 210 GHz WVR at the H.E.S.S. site</h2></a>Authors:  Lott Frans, Michael Backes, Heino Falcke, Tiziana Venturi</br>Comments: 12 pages, 12 figures, published by RAS Techniques and Instruments</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, physics.ao-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) site and the Gamsberg Mountain
have been identified as potential sites for the Africa Millimetre Telescope
(AMT). The AMT is poised to observe at millimetre and possibly at submillimetre
wavelengths. At these wavelengths, precipitable water vapour (PWV) in the
atmosphere is the main source of opacity during observations and therefore
needs to be accurately assessed at the potential sites for the AMT. In order to
investigate the PWV conditions for the AMT, identical Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS) stations were installed and used to assess the PWV at
the two potential sites. In this study, the accuracy of those PWV measurements
by the GNSS stations was assessed by comparing the H.E.S.S. installed GNSS
station PWV measurements to that from a 210 GHz Water Vapour Radiometer (WVR)
also installed at the H.E.S.S. site. A correlation of 98% and an offset of 0.34
mm was found between the GNSS station and the 210 GHz WVR PWV data when on-site
pressure and the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (NGL) weighted mean temperature
($\mathrm{T_m}$) were used calculate the GNSS station PWV data. In comparison,
the offset reduces to 0.15 mm when on-site derived $\mathrm{T_m}$ and pressure
were used to calculate the GNSS station PWV. The results show that the GNSS
station with on-site meteorological data can be used with high accuracy to
reliably determine the PWV conditions at the H.E.S.S. site.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04802v1"><h2>ORBIT-2: Scaling Exascale Vision Foundation Models for Weather and
  Climate Downscaling</h2></a>Authors:  Xiao Wang, Jong-Youl Choi, Takuya Kurihaya, Isaac Lyngaas, Hong-Jun Yoon, Ming Fan, Nasik Muhammad Nafi, Aristeidis Tsaris, Ashwin M. Aji, Maliha Hossain, Mohamed Wahib, Dali Wang, Peter Thornton, Prasanna Balaprakash, Moetasim Ashfaq, Dan Lu</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.EP, cs.AI, cs.DC, physics.ao-ph</br><p>Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models limit effective
regional decision-making, underscoring the need for robust downscaling.
However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and
geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision
Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation
model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates
two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture
with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust
prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces
self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence
processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters
across 32,768 GPUs, achieving up to 1.8 ExaFLOPS sustained throughput and
92-98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global
resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution
benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with R^2 scores in the range of 0.98
to 0.99 against observation data.</p></br>
