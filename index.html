evolutionary models. By interpreting the input parameters and output properties
of these models as multi-dimensional probability distributions, we train
conditional normalizing flows to learn and predict the complex relationships
between grid inputs and outputs in the form of conditional joint distributions.
Leveraging the expressive power and versatility of these flows, we showcase
their ability to emulate a variety of evolutionary tracks and isochrones across
a continuous range of input parameters. In addition, we describe a simple
Bayesian approach for estimating stellar parameters using these flows and
demonstrate its application to asteroseismic datasets of red giants observed by
the Kepler mission. By applying this approach to red giants in open clusters
NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, we illustrate how large age uncertainties can arise when
fitting only to global asteroseismic and spectroscopic parameters without prior
information on initial helium abundances and mixing length parameter values. We
also conduct inference using the flow at a large scale by determining revised
estimates of masses and radii for 15,388 field red giants. These estimates show
improved agreement with results from existing grid-based modelling, reveal
distinct population-level features in the red clump, and suggest that the
masses of Kepler red giants previously determined using the corrected
asteroseismic scaling relations have been overestimated by 5-10%.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09602v1"><h2>Real-time gravitational-wave inference for binary neutron stars using
  machine learning</h2></a>Authors:  Maximilian Dax, Stephen R. Green, Jonathan Gair, Nihar Gupte, Michael Pürrer, Vivien Raymond, Jonas Wildberger, Jakob H. Macke, Alessandra Buonanno, Bernhard Schölkopf</br>Comments: 8+7 pages, 3+5 figures</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Mergers of binary neutron stars (BNSs) emit signals in both the
gravitational-wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) spectra. Famously, the 2017
multi-messenger observation of GW170817 led to scientific discoveries across
cosmology, nuclear physics, and gravity. Central to these results were the sky
localization and distance obtained from GW data, which, in the case of
GW170817, helped to identify the associated EM transient, AT 2017gfo, 11 hours
after the GW signal. Fast analysis of GW data is critical for directing
time-sensitive EM observations; however, due to challenges arising from the
length and complexity of signals, it is often necessary to make approximations
that sacrifice accuracy. Here, we develop a machine learning approach that
performs complete BNS inference in just one second without making any such
approximations. This is enabled by a new method for explicit integration of
physical domain knowledge into neural networks. Our approach enhances
multi-messenger observations by providing (i) accurate localization even before
the merger; (ii) improved localization precision by $\sim30\%$ compared to
approximate low-latency methods; and (iii) detailed information on luminosity
distance, inclination, and masses, which can be used to prioritize expensive
telescope time. Additionally, the flexibility and reduced cost of our method
open new opportunities for equation-of-state and waveform systematics studies.
Finally, we demonstrate that our method scales to extremely long signals, up to
an hour in length, thus serving as a blueprint for data analysis for
next-generation ground- and space-based detectors.</p></br>
