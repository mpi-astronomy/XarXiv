Greenberg, Nicola Tosi</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>Mantle convection simulations are an essential tool for understanding how
rocky planets evolve. However, the poorly known input parameters to these
simulations, the non-linear dependence of transport properties on pressure and
temperature, and the long integration times in excess of several billion years
all pose a computational challenge for numerical solvers. We propose a
physics-based machine learning approach that predicts creeping flow velocities
as a function of temperature while conserving mass, thereby bypassing the
numerical solution of the Stokes problem. A finite-volume solver then uses the
predicted velocities to advect and diffuse the temperature field to the next
time-step, enabling autoregressive rollout at inference. For training, our
model requires temperature-velocity snapshots from a handful of simulations
(94). We consider mantle convection in a two-dimensional rectangular box with
basal and internal heating, pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity.
Overall, our model is up to 89 times faster than the numerical solver. We also
show the importance of different components in our convolutional neural network
architecture such as mass conservation, learned paddings on the boundaries, and
loss scaling for the overall rollout performance. Finally, we test our approach
on unseen scenarios to demonstrate some of its strengths and weaknesses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16320v1"><h2>Learning novel representations of variable sources from multi-modal
  $\textit{Gaia}$ data via autoencoders</h2></a>Authors:  P. Huijse, J. De Ridder, L. Eyer, L. Rimoldini, B. Holl, N. Chornay, J. Roquette, K. Nienartowicz, G. Jevardat de Fombelle, D. J.

  referee report, 20 pages, 20 figures, 2 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) published for the first time epoch photometry,
BP/RP (XP) low-resolution mean spectra, and supervised classification results
for millions of variable sources. This extensive dataset offers a unique
opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data
products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning
methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an
unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4
million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE),
which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and
generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a
novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G
band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is
compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional
latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The
learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes
between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated
through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent
space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and
low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the
different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent
variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with
astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for
astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent
representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks,
including classification, clustering and outlier detection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17592v1"><h2>AstroMLab 4: Benchmark-Topping Performance in Astronomy Q&A with a
  70B-Parameter Domain-Specialized Reasoning Model</h2></a>Authors:  Tijmen de Haan, Yuan-Sen Ting, Tirthankar Ghosal, Tuan Dung Nguyen, Alberto Accomazzi, Emily Herron, Vanessa Lama, Rui Pan, Azton Wells, Nesar Ramachandra</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>General-purpose large language models, despite their broad capabilities,
often struggle with specialized domain knowledge, a limitation particularly
pronounced in more accessible, lower-parameter versions. This gap hinders their
deployment as effective agents in demanding fields such as astronomy. Building
on our prior work with AstroSage-8B, this study introduces AstroSage-70B, a
significantly larger and more advanced domain-specialized natural-language AI
assistant. It is designed for research and education across astronomy,
astrophysics, space science, astroparticle physics, cosmology, and astronomical
instrumentation. Developed from the Llama-3.1-70B foundation, AstroSage-70B
underwent extensive continued pre-training on a vast corpus of astronomical
literature, followed by supervised fine-tuning and model merging. Beyond its
70-billion parameter scale, this model incorporates refined datasets,
judiciously chosen learning hyperparameters, and improved training procedures,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex astronomical tasks. Notably,
we integrated reasoning chains into the SFT dataset, enabling AstroSage-70B to
either answer the user query immediately, or first emit a human-readable
thought process. Evaluated on the AstroMLab-1 benchmark -- comprising 4,425
questions from literature withheld during training -- AstroSage-70B achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It surpasses all other tested open-weight and
proprietary models, including leading systems like o3, Gemini-2.5-Pro,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen-3-235B, even those with API costs two
orders of magnitude higher. This work demonstrates that domain specialization,
when applied to large-scale models, can enable them to outperform generalist
counterparts in specialized knowledge areas like astronomy, thereby advancing
the frontier of AI capabilities in the field.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18643v1"><h2>Anomaly detection in radio galaxy data with trainable COSFIRE filters</h2></a>Authors:  Steven Ndung'u, Trienko Grobler, Stefan J. Wijnholds, George Azzopardi</br>Comments: 5 pages, URSI Asia-Pacific Radio Science Conference and URSI Radio
  Science Letters (RSL)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Detecting anomalies in radio astronomy is challenging due to the vast amounts
of data and the rarity of labeled anomalous examples. Addressing this challenge
requires efficient methods capable of identifying unusual radio galaxy
morphologies without relying on extensive supervision. This work introduces an
innovative approach to anomaly detection based on morphological characteristics
of the radio sources using trainable COSFIRE (Combination of Shifted Filter
Responses) filters as an efficient alternative to complex deep learning
methods. The framework integrates COSFIRE descriptors with an unsupervised
Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm to identify unusual radio galaxy
morphologies. Evaluations on a radio galaxy benchmark data set demonstrate
strong performance, with the COSFIRE-based approach achieving a geometric mean
(G-Mean) score of 79%, surpassing the 77% achieved by a computationally
intensive deep learning autoencoder. By characterizing normal patterns and
detecting deviations, this semi-supervised methodology overcomes the need for
anomalous examples in the training set, a major limitation of traditional
supervised methods. This approach shows promise for next-generation radio
telescopes, where fast processing and the ability to discover unknown phenomena
are crucial.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17814v1"><h2>Searching for extreme mass ratio inspirals in LISA: from identification
  to parameter estimation</h2></a>Authors:  Stefan H. Strub, Lorenzo Speri, Domenico Giardini</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an, physics.space-ph</br><p>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is a planned space-based
observatory designed to detect gravitational waves (GWs) within the millihertz
frequency range. LISA is anticipated to observe the inspiral of compact objects
into black holes at the centers of galaxies, so called extreme-mass-ratio
inspirals (EMRIs). However, the extraction of these long-lived complex signals
is challenging due to the large size and multimodality of the search space. In
this study, we introduce a new search strategy that allows us to find EMRI
signals in noisy data from wide priors all the way to performing parameter
estimation. This work is an important step in understanding how to extract
EMRIs from future LISA data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19896v1"><h2>Large Language Models as Autonomous Spacecraft Operators in Kerbal Space
  Program</h2></a>Authors:  Alejandro Carrasco, Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez, Richard Linares</br>Comments: Non revised version for paper going to be published in Journal of
  Advances in Space Research</br>Primary Category: cs.AI</br>All Categories: cs.AI, astro-ph.IM, cs.CL</br><p>Recent trends are emerging in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
autonomous agents that take actions based on the content of the user text
prompts. We intend to apply these concepts to the field of Control in space,
enabling LLMs to play a significant role in the decision-making process for
autonomous satellite operations. As a first step towards this goal, we have
developed a pure LLM-based solution for the Kerbal Space Program Differential
Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software design competition where
participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering satellites involved in
non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP game engine. Our approach
leverages prompt engineering, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning techniques to
create an effective LLM-based agent that ranked 2nd in the competition. To the
best of our knowledge, this work pioneers the integration of LLM agents into
space research. The project comprises several open repositories to facilitate
replication and further research. The codebase is accessible on
\href{https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/kspdg}{GitHub}, while the trained models
and datasets are available on \href{https://huggingface.co/OhhTuRnz}{Hugging

  Fuel Heating and Prospects for Delayed-Detonations</h2></a>Authors:  Ezra Brooker, Andrey Zhiglo, Tomasz Plewa</br>Comments: 17 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, physics.data-an</br><p>The aim of this work is to characterize the thermodynamic state of fuel mixed
into the turbulent flame brush in the context of the Zel'dovich
deflagration-to-detonation transition (ZDDT) mechanism of Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia). We perform a series of three-dimensional computer simulations of
thermonuclear deflagrations subject to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI)
for conditions found in model explosions of centrally ignited realistic,
Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf progenitors. These conditions correspond to
explosion times when the flame reaches low density progenitor regions where DDT
is expected to occur. The flame database is constructed using a thickened flame
model. High numerical resolution is achieved with the help of the adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) approach allowing, for the first time, to resolve mesoscale
buoyancy-driven flame turbulence. The system is evolved to a quasi-steady
state, and flow properties in the turbulent region, where turbulence is most
isotropic, is analyzed in a co-moving frame of reference. We find evidence for
strong buoyancy-driven adiabatic heating of fuel layers adjacent to the flame
front. The heating results in a dramatic reduction of fuel ignition times by
between $\approx$2 and more than about 5 orders of magnitude. The heating
increases with the RTI forcing. The observed shortening of fuel burning
timescales suggests a new source of energy is important inside fuel penetrating
the flame brush. These regions are up to several hundred meters wide. On the
basis of the previous results of turbulent combustion in SNe Ia,
preconditioning required by the ZDDT mechanism can occur there.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18900v1"><h2>Dynamical Dark Energy at Late Time $Λ$CDM</h2></a>Authors:  J. W. Moffat, E. J. Thompson</br>Comments: 16 pages, 6 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-th, physics.data-an</br><p>We investigate the dynamical properties of dark energy through a detailed
analysis of its equation of state parameter $w(z)$ as a function of redshift.
We derive a general expression for $w(z)$ from the
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) equations, establishing a direct
relationship between the dark energy equation of state and the observable
Hubble parameter $H(z)$ and its derivative. Using the relation $w(z) = -1 +
\frac{2(1+z)}{3H(z)} \frac{dH}{dz}$, we develop an approximation method valid
for $z \lesssim 1$ that accounts for the changing balance between matter and
dark energy contributions to cosmic expansion. We compare our theoretical
framework with recent observational data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) DR2, analysing how well the commonly used
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization $w(z) = -1 + w_a
\frac{z}{1+z}$ captures the evolution of dark energy. Our results indicate that
the dark energy equation of state exhibits a monotonic evolution with redshift,
transitioning from deceleration to acceleration around $z \approx 0.7$.
Notably, our predicted $w_{\mathrm{DE}}$ remains greater than $-1$ across all
redshifts, avoiding phantom energy scenarios that would violate the null energy
condition. This work demonstrates how precise measurements of the cosmic
expansion history can constrain the nature of dark energy and provides a
framework for testing dynamical dark energy models against current and future
cosmological observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19083v1"><h2>Geometric Determinations Of Characteristic Redshifts From DESI-DR2 BAO
  and DES-SN5YR Observations: Hints For New Expansion Rate Anomalies</h2></a>Authors:  Purba Mukherjee, Anjan A Sen</br>Comments: 21 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables. Comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, gr-qc</br><p>In this work, we perform a model-agnostic reconstruction of the cosmic
expansion history by combining DESI-DR2 BAO and DES-SN5YR data, with a focus on
geometric determination of characteristic redshifts where notable tensions in
the expansion rate are found to emerge. Employing Gaussian process regression
alongside knot-based spline techniques, we reconstruct cosmic distances and
their derivatives to pinpoint these characteristic redshifts and infer $E(z)$.
Our analysis reveals significant deviations of approximately 4 to 5$\sigma$
from the Planck 2018 $\Lambda$CDM predictions, particularly pronounced in the
redshift range $z \sim 0.35-0.55$. These anomalies are consistently observed
across both reconstruction methods and combined datasets, indicating robust
late-time departures that could signal new physics beyond the standard
cosmological framework. The joint use of BAO and SN probes enhances the
precision of our constraints, allowing us to isolate these deviations without
reliance on specific cosmological assumptions. Our findings underscore the role
of characteristic redshifts as sensitive indicators of expansion rate anomalies
and motivate further scrutiny with forthcoming datasets from DESI-5YR BAO,
Euclid, and LSST. These future surveys will tighten constraints and help
distinguish whether these late-time anomalies arise from new fundamental
physics or unresolved systematics in the data.</p></br>
