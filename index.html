  Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs)</h2></a>Authors:  M. Garcia-Fernandez</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, cs.AI</br><p>Accurate and reliable photometric redshifts determination is one of the key
aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric
redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning
and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of
galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are determined. On this paper,
we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of
galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). Proposed
CGAN implementation, approaches photometric redshift determination as a
probabilistic regression, where instead of determining a single value for the
estimated redshift of the galaxy, a full probability density is computed. The
methodology proposed, is tested with data from Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 data
and compared with other existing algorithm such as a Random Forest regressor.</p></br>
