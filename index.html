  Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range</h2></a>Authors:  Sojun Ono, Kazuyuki Sugimura</br>Comments: 18 pages, 7 figures, Submitted to ApJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution
in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the
thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of
magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H,
H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic
range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate
deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly
sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10%
in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for
the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU
and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with
conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions
under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method,
where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the
predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation
timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the
timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even
with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time.
This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based
chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16990v1"><h2>Score Matching on Large Geometric Graphs for Cosmology Generation</h2></a>Authors:  Diana-Alexandra Onutu, Yue Zhao, Joaquin Vanschoren, Vlado Menkovski</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.AI</br><p>Generative models are a promising tool to produce cosmological simulations
but face significant challenges in scalability, physical consistency, and
adherence to domain symmetries, limiting their utility as alternatives to
$N$-body simulations. To address these limitations, we introduce a score-based
generative model with an equivariant graph neural network that simulates
gravitational clustering of galaxies across cosmologies starting from an
informed prior, respects periodic boundaries, and scales to full galaxy counts
in simulations. A novel topology-aware noise schedule, crucial for large
geometric graphs, is introduced. The proposed equivariant score-based model
successfully generates full-scale cosmological point clouds of up to 600,000
halos, respects periodicity and a uniform prior, and outperforms existing
diffusion models in capturing clustering statistics while offering significant
computational advantages. This work advances cosmology by introducing a
generative model designed to closely resemble the underlying gravitational
clustering of structure formation, moving closer to physically realistic and
efficient simulators for the evolution of large-scale structures in the
universe.</p></br>
