entire sky in Full-Frame Image mode with a time resolution of 200 seconds to 30
minutes and a temporal baseline of at least 27 days. In addition to the primary
goal of discovering new exoplanets, TESS is exceptionally capable at detecting
variable stars, and in particular short-period eclipsing binaries which are
relatively common, making up a few percent of all stars, and represent powerful
astrophysical laboratories for deep investigations of stellar formation and
evolution. We combed Sectors 1-82 of TESS Full-Frame Image data searching for
eclipsing binary stars using a neural network that identified ~1.2 million
stars with eclipse-like features. Of these, we have performed an in-depth
analysis on ~60,000 targets using automated methods and manual inspection by
citizen scientists. Here we present a catalog of 10001 uniformly-vetted and
-validated eclipsing binary stars that passed all our ephemeris and photocenter
tests, as well as complementary visual inspection. Of these, 7936 are new
eclipsing binaries while the remaining 2065 are known systems for which we
update the published ephemerides. We outline the detection and analysis of the
targets, discuss the properties of the sample, and highlight potentially
interesting systems. Finally, we also provide a list of ~900,000 unvetted and
unvalidated targets for which the neural network found eclipse-like features
with a score higher than 0.9, and for which there are no known eclipsing
binaries within a sky-projected separation of a TESS pixel (~21 arcsec).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05556v1"><h2>DART-Vetter: A Deep LeARning Tool for automatic triage of exoplanet
  candidates</h2></a>Authors:  Stefano Fiscale, Laura Inno, Alessandra Rotundi, Angelo Ciaramella, Alessio Ferone, Christian Magliano, Luca Cacciapuoti, Veselin Kostov, Elisa Quintana, Giovanni Covone, Maria Teresa Muscari Tomajoli, Vito Saggese, Luca Tonietti, Antonio Vanzanella, Vincenzo Della Corte</br>Comments: Number of pages: 24, Number of figures: 8, Article accepted for
  publication in The Astronomical Journal on 2025-05-30</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>In the identification of new planetary candidates in transit surveys, the
employment of Deep Learning models proved to be essential to efficiently
analyse a continuously growing volume of photometric observations. To further
improve the robustness of these models, it is necessary to exploit the
complementarity of data collected from different transit surveys such as NASA's
Kepler, Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and, in the near future,
the ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillation of stars (PLATO) mission. In this
work, we present a Deep Learning model, named DART-Vetter, able to distinguish
planetary candidates (PC) from false positives signals (NPC) detected by any
potential transiting survey. DART-Vetter is a Convolutional Neural Network that
processes only the light curves folded on the period of the relative signal,
featuring a simpler and more compact architecture with respect to other
triaging and/or vetting models available in the literature. We trained and
tested DART-Vetter on several dataset of publicly available and homogeneously
labelled TESS and Kepler light curves in order to prove the effectiveness of
our model. Despite its simplicity, DART-Vetter achieves highly competitive
triaging performance, with a recall rate of 91% on an ensemble of TESS and
Kepler data, when compared to Exominer and Astronet-Triage. Its compact, open
source and easy to replicate architecture makes DART-Vetter a particularly
useful tool for automatizing triaging procedures or assisting human vetters,
showing a discrete generalization on TCEs with Multiple Event Statistic (MES) >
20 and orbital period < 50 days.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06087v1"><h2>Multilevel neural simulation-based inference</h2></a>Authors:  Yuga Hikida, Ayush Bharti, Niall Jeffrey, François-Xavier Briol</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: stat.ML</br>All Categories: stat.ML, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, stat.CO</br><p>Neural simulation-based inference (SBI) is a popular set of methods for
Bayesian inference when models are only available in the form of a simulator.
These methods are widely used in the sciences and engineering, where writing
down a likelihood can be significantly more challenging than constructing a
simulator. However, the performance of neural SBI can suffer when simulators
are computationally expensive, thereby limiting the number of simulations that
can be performed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to neural SBI
which leverages multilevel Monte Carlo techniques for settings where several
simulators of varying cost and fidelity are available. We demonstrate through
both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments that our method can
significantly enhance the accuracy of SBI methods given a fixed computational
budget.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04973v1"><h2>Bayesian network 3D event reconstruction in the Cygno optical TPC for
  dark matter direct detection</h2></a>Authors:  Fernando Domingues Amaro, Rita Antonietti, Elisabetta Baracchini, Luigi Benussi, Stefano Bianco, Francesco Borra, Cesidio Capoccia, Michele Caponero, Gianluca Cavoto, Igor Abritta Costa, Antonio Croce, Emiliano Dané, Melba D'Astolfo, Giorgio Dho, Flaminia Di Giambattista, Emanuele Di Marco, Giulia D'Imperio, Matteo Folcarelli, Joaquim Marques Ferreira dos Santos, Davide Fiorina, Francesco Iacoangeli, Zahoor Ul Islam, Herman Pessoa Lima Júnior, Ernesto Kemp, Giovanni Maccarrone, Rui Daniel Passos Mano, David José Gaspar Marques, Luan Gomes Mattosinhos de Carvalhoand Giovanni Mazzitelli, Alasdair Gregor McLean, Pietro Meloni, Andrea Messina, Cristina Maria Bernardes Monteiro, Rafael Antunes Nobrega, Igor Fonseca Pains, Emiliano Paoletti, Luciano Passamonti, Fabrizio Petrucci, Stefano Piacentini, Davide Piccolo, Daniele Pierluigi, Davide Pinci, Atul Prajapati, Francesco Renga, Rita Joana Cruz Roque, Filippo Rosatelli, Alessandro Russo, Giovanna Saviano, Pedro Alberto Oliveira Costa Silva, Neil John Curwen Spooner, Roberto Tesauro, Sandro Tomassini, Samuele Torelli, Donatella Tozzi</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: physics.ins-det</br>All Categories: physics.ins-det, astro-ph.IM, hep-ex, physics.data-an</br><p>The CYGNO experiment is developing a high-resolution gaseous Time Projection
Chamber with optical readout for directional dark matter searches. The detector
uses a helium-tetrafluoromethane (He:CF$_4$ 60:40) gas mixture at atmospheric
pressure and a triple Gas Electron Multiplier amplification stage, coupled with
a scientific camera for high-resolution 2D imaging and fast photomultipliers
for time-resolved scintillation light detection. This setup enables 3D event
reconstruction: photomultipliers signals provide depth information, while the
camera delivers high-precision transverse resolution. In this work, we present
a Bayesian Network-based algorithm designed to reconstruct the events using
only the photomultipliers signals, yielding a full 3D description of the
particle trajectories. The algorithm models the light collection process
probabilistically and estimates spatial and intensity parameters on the Gas
Electron Multiplier plane, where light emission occurs. It is implemented
within the Bayesian Analysis Toolkit and uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling
for posterior inference. Validation using data from the CYGNO LIME prototype
shows accurate reconstruction of localized and extended tracks. Results
demonstrate that the Bayesian approach enables robust 3D description and, when
combined with camera data, further improves the precision of track
reconstruction. This methodology represents a significant step forward in
directional dark matter detection, enhancing the identification of nuclear
recoil tracks with high spatial resolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05758v1"><h2>Mapping correlations and coherence: adjacency-based approach to data
  visualization and regularity discovery</h2></a>Authors:  Guang-Xing Li</br>Comments: Code is avaliable at
  https://github.com/gxli/Adjacent-Correlation-Analysis</br>Primary Category: physics.comp-ph</br>All Categories: physics.comp-ph, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, math.DS</br><p>The development of science has been transforming man's view towards nature
for centuries. Observing structures and patterns in an effective approach to
discover regularities from data is a key step toward theory-building. With
increasingly complex data being obtained, revealing regularities systematically
has become a challenge. Correlation is a most commonly-used and effective
approach to describe regularities in data, yet for complex patterns, spatial
inhomogeneity and complexity can often undermine the correlations. We present
an algorithm to derive maps representing the type and degree of correlations,
by taking the two-fold symmetry of the correlation vector into full account
using the Stokes parameter. The method allows for a spatially resolved view of
the nature and strength of correlations between physical quantities. In the
correlation view, a region can often be separated into different subregions
with different types of correlations. Subregions correspond to physical regimes
for physical systems, or climate zones for climate maps. The simplicity of the
method makes it widely applicable to a variety of data, where the
correlation-based approach makes the map particularly useful in revealing
regularities in physical systems and alike. As a new and efficient approach to
represent data, the method should facilitate the development of new
computational approaches to regularity discovery.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05759v1"><h2>Revealing hidden correlations from complex spatial distributions:
  Adjacent Correlation Analysis</h2></a>Authors:  Guang-Xing Li</br>Comments: Code avaliable at
  https://github.com/gxli/Adjacent-Correlation-Analysis</br>Primary Category: physics.comp-ph</br>All Categories: physics.comp-ph, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, math.DS</br><p>Physics has been transforming our view of nature for centuries. While
combining physical knowledge with computational approaches has enabled detailed
modeling of physical systems' evolution, understanding the emergence of
patterns and structures remains limited. Correlations between quantities are
the most reliable approach to describe relationships between different
variables. However, for complex patterns, directly searching for correlations
is often impractical, as complexity and spatial inhomogeneity can obscure
correlations. We discovered that the key is to search for correlations in local
regions and developed a new method, adjacent correlation analysis, to extract
such correlations and represent them in phase space. When multiple observations
are available, a useful way to study a system is to analyze distributions in
phase space using the Probability Density Function (PDF). Adjacent correlation
analysis evaluates vectors representing local correlations, which can be
overlaid on the PDF plot to form the adjacent correlation plot. These
correlation vectors often exhibit remarkably regular patterns and may lead to
the discovery of new laws. The vectors we derive are equivalent to the vector
field in dynamical systems on the attracting manifold. By efficiently
representing spatial patterns as correlation vectors in phase space, our
approach opens avenues for classification, prediction, parameter fitting, and
forecasting.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04491v1"><h2>GollumFit: An IceCube Open-Source Framework for Binned-Likelihood
  Neutrino Telescope Analyses</h2></a>Authors:  IceCube Collaboration</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: hep-ex</br>All Categories: hep-ex, astro-ph.HE, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>We present GollumFit, a framework designed for performing binned-likelihood
analyses on neutrino telescope data. GollumFit incorporates model parameters
common to any neutrino telescope and also model parameters specific to the
IceCube Neutrino Observatory. We provide a high-level overview of its key
features and how the code is organized. We then discuss the performance of the
fitting in a typical analysis scenario, highlighting the ability to fit over
tens of nuisance parameters. We present some examples showing how to use the
package for likelihood minimization tasks. This framework uniquely incorporates
the particular model parameters necessary for neutrino telescopes, and solves
an associated likelihood problem in a time-efficient manner.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05657v1"><h2>Emulating compact binary population synthesis simulations with robust
  uncertainty quantification and model comparison: Bayesian normalizing flows</h2></a>Authors:  Anarya Ray</br>Comments: 16 pages, 4 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.HE</br>All Categories: astro-ph.HE, cs.LG, gr-qc</br><p>Population synthesis simulations of compact binary coalescences~(CBCs) play a
crucial role in extracting astrophysical insights from an ensemble of
gravitational wave~(GW) observations. However, realistic simulations are costly
to implement for a dense grid of initial conditions. Normalizing flows can
emulate the distribution functions of a simulated population of binary
parameters and thereby enable empirical constraints on the astrophysical
initial conditions and branching fractions of various formation channels given
data from a catalog of GW observations. They can also be used for data
amplification in sparse regions of the CBC parameter space to guide the
development of phenomenological population models for rarely synthesizable
systems with components in theorized mass gaps, without having to simulate a
prohibitively large number of binaries. But flow predictions are wrought with
uncertainties, especially for sparse training sets. In this work I develop a
method for quantifying and marginalizing uncertainties in the emulators by
introducing the Bayesian Normalizing flow, a conditional density estimator
constructed from Bayesian neural networks. Using the exact likelihood function
associated with density estimators I sample the posterior distribution of flow
parameters with suitably chosen priors to quantify and marginalize over flow
uncertainties. I demonstrate the accuracy, calibration, and data-amplification
impacts of the estimated uncertainties for simulations of binary black hole
populations formed through common envelope evolution. I outline applications of
the methodology in simulation-based inference from growing GW catalogs and
sketch other uses for general simulation-based approaches in GW astronomy.</p></br>
