  Objects with Machine Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Bryce T. Bolin, Michael W. Coughlin</br>Comments: 25 pages, 9 figures, accepted chapter in Machine Learning for Small

  Oszkiewicz, Elsevier, 2024, p. 209-227</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the use of Machine Learning methods for the
identification and localization of cometary activity for Solar System objects
in ground and in space-based wide-field all-sky surveys. We will begin the
chapter by discussing the challenges of identifying known and unknown active,
extended Solar System objects in the presence of stellar-type sources and the
application of classical pre-ML identification techniques and their
limitations. We will then transition to the discussion of implementing ML
techniques to address the challenge of extended object identification. We will
finish with prospective future methods and the application to future surveys
such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15263v1"><h2>The Palomar twilight survey of 'Ayló'chaxnim, Atiras, and comets</h2></a>Authors:  B. T. Bolin, F. J.

interior to the orbit of Venus (Aylos), the Earth (Atiras), and comets. We
present the results of observations with the Palomar 48-inch telescope
(P48)/Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera in 30 s r-band exposures taken
during evening astronomical twilight from 2019 Sep 20 to 2022 March 7 and
during morning astronomical twilight sky from 2019 Sep 21 to 2022 Sep 29. More
than 46,000 exposures were taken in evening and morning astronomical twilight
within 31 to 66 degrees from the Sun with an r-band limiting magnitude between
18.1 and 20.9. The twilight pointings show a slight seasonal dependence in
limiting magnitude and ability to point closer towards the Sun, with limiting
magnitude slightly improving during summer. In total, the one Aylo, (594913)
'Ayl\'o'chaxnim, and 4 Atiras, 2020 OV1, 2021 BS1, 2021 PB2, and 2021 VR3, were
discovered in evening and morning twilight observations. Additional twilight
survey discoveries also include 6 long-period comets: C/2020 T2, C/2020 V2,
C/2021 D2, C/2021 E3, C/2022 E3, and C/2022 P3, and two short-period comets:
P/2021 N1 and P/2022 P2 using deep learning comet detection pipelines. The
P48/ZTF twilight survey also recovered 11 known Atiras, one Aylo, three
short-period comes, two long-period comets, and one interstellar object.
Lastly, the Vera Rubin Observatory will conduct a twilight survey starting in
its first year of operations and will cover the sky within 45 degrees of the
Sun. Twilight surveys such as those by ZTF and future surveys will provide
opportunities for discovering asteroids inside the orbits of Earth and Venus.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17178v1"><h2>MODEL&CO: Exoplanet detection in angular differential imaging by
  learning across multiple observations</h2></a>Authors:  Théo Bodrito, Olivier Flasseur, Julien Mairal, Jean Ponce, Maud Langlois, Anne-Marie Lagrange</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.CV, physics.data-an</br><p>Direct imaging of exoplanets is particularly challenging due to the high
contrast between the planet and the star luminosities, and their small angular
separation. In addition to tailored instrumental facilities implementing
adaptive optics and coronagraphy, post-processing methods combining several
images recorded in pupil tracking mode are needed to attenuate the nuisances
corrupting the signals of interest. Most of these post-processing methods build
a model of the nuisances from the target observations themselves, resulting in
strongly limited detection sensitivity at short angular separations due to the
lack of angular diversity. To address this issue, we propose to build the
nuisance model from an archive of multiple observations by leveraging
supervised deep learning techniques. The proposed approach casts the detection
problem as a reconstruction task and captures the structure of the nuisance
from two complementary representations of the data. Unlike methods inspired by
reference differential imaging, the proposed model is highly non-linear and
does not resort to explicit image-to-image similarity measurements and
subtractions. The proposed approach also encompasses statistical modeling of
learnable spatial features. The latter is beneficial to improve both the
detection sensitivity and the robustness against heterogeneous data. We apply
the proposed algorithm to several datasets from the VLT/SPHERE instrument, and
demonstrate a superior precision-recall trade-off compared to the PACO
algorithm. Interestingly, the gain is especially important when the diversity
induced by ADI is the most limited, thus supporting the ability of the proposed
approach to learn information across multiple observations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17228v1"><h2>Disk2Planet: A Robust and Automated Machine Learning Tool for Parameter
  Inference in Disk-Planet Systems</h2></a>Authors:  Shunyuan Mao, Ruobing Dong, Kwang Moo Yi, Lu Lu, Sifan Wang, Paris Perdikaris</br>Comments: Accepted to ApJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>We introduce Disk2Planet, a machine learning-based tool to infer key
parameters in disk-planet systems from observed protoplanetary disk structures.
Disk2Planet takes as input the disk structures in the form of two-dimensional
density and velocity maps, and outputs disk and planet properties, that is, the
Shakura--Sunyaev viscosity, the disk aspect ratio, the planet--star mass ratio,
and the planet's radius and azimuth. We integrate the Covariance Matrix
Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA--ES), an evolutionary algorithm tailored for
complex optimization problems, and the Protoplanetary Disk Operator Network
(PPDONet), a neural network designed to predict solutions of disk--planet
interactions. Our tool is fully automated and can retrieve parameters in one
system in three minutes on an Nvidia A100 graphics processing unit. We
empirically demonstrate that our tool achieves percent-level or higher
accuracy, and is able to handle missing data and unknown levels of noise.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17421v1"><h2>Solar Active Regions Emergence Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory
  Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Spiridon Kasapis, Irina N. Kitiashvili, Alexander G. Kosovichev, John T. Stefan</br>Comments: 20 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, under review at the AAS Astrophysical
  Journal</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>We developed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict the formation of
active regions (ARs) on the solar surface. Using the Doppler shift velocity,
the continuum intensity, and the magnetic field observations from the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI), we have
created time-series datasets of acoustic power and magnetic flux, which are
used to train LSTM models on predicting continuum intensity, 12 hours in
advance. These novel machine learning (ML) models are able to capture
variations of the acoustic power density associated with upcoming magnetic flux
emergence and continuum intensity decrease. Testing of the models' performance
was done on data for 5 ARs, unseen from the models during training. Model 8,
the best performing model trained, was able to make a successful prediction of
emergence for all testing active regions in an experimental setting and three
of them in an operational. The model predicted the emergence of AR11726,
AR13165, and AR13179 respectively 10, 29, and 5 hours in advance, and
variations of this model achieved average RMSE values of 0.11 for both active
and quiet areas on the solar disc. This work sets the foundations for ML-aided
prediction of solar ARs.</p></br>
