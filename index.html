It implements stable numerical differentiation and derivative assembly utilities for Fisher-matrix forecasting and higher-order likelihood approximations in scientific applications, supporting scalar- and vector-valued models including black-box or tabulated functions where automatic differentiation is impractical or unavailable. These derivatives are used to construct Fisher forecasts, Fisher bias estimates, and non-Gaussian likelihood expansions based on the Derivative Approximation for Likelihoods (DALI). By extending derivative-based inference beyond the Gaussian approximation, DerivKit forms a practical bridge between fast Fisher forecasts and more computationally intensive sampling-based methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.07284v1"><h2>Imagining the Alien: Human Projections and Cognitive Limitations</h2></a>Authors:  S. G. Djorgovski</br>Comments: 11 pages, from the refereed proceedings of the Inspiration of Astronomical Phenomena XII (INSAP XII) conference held in Corfu, Greece, May 2024, eds. N. Campion, J. Hatch, H. Henry, C. Impey and V. Shrimplin</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, physics.pop-ph</br><p>Imagining what life on other planets, and intelligent life in particular, may be like is a long-running theme in human culture. It is a manifestation of the innate human curiosity about the Cosmos, and it has inspired numerous works of art and folklore, including whole literary and other media genres. It is a profound question, with philosophical and existential implications. There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind. Interestingly, we did create what is effectively an alien intelligence on this planet in the form of now rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI). As its capabilities grow, it may give us new insights into what extraterrestrial advanced intelligences may be like.</p></br>
