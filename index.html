  Problem</h2></a>Authors:  Alvaro Francisco Gil, Walther Litteri, Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez, David Camacho, Massimiliano Vasile</br>Comments: SPAICE Conference 2024 (7 pages)</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.EP, cs.AI</br><p>The Three-Body Problem has fascinated scientists for centuries and it has
been crucial in the design of modern space missions. Recent developments in
Generative Artificial Intelligence hold transformative promise for addressing
this longstanding problem. This work investigates the use of Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) and its internal representation to generate periodic orbits.
We utilize a comprehensive dataset of periodic orbits in the Circular
Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) to train deep-learning architectures that
capture key orbital characteristics, and we set up physical evaluation metrics
for the generated trajectories. Through this investigation, we seek to enhance
the understanding of how Generative AI can improve space mission planning and
astrodynamics research, leading to novel, data-driven approaches in the field.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03445v1"><h2>Spacecraft inertial parameters estimation using time series clustering
  and reinforcement learning</h2></a>Authors:  Konstantinos Platanitis, Miguel Arana-Catania, Leonardo Capicchiano, Saurabh Upadhyay, Leonard Felicetti</br>Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table. To be presented in ESA - AI for Space
  (SPAICE)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, cs.RO</br><p>This paper presents a machine learning approach to estimate the inertial
parameters of a spacecraft in cases when those change during operations, e.g.
multiple deployments of payloads, unfolding of appendages and booms, propellant
consumption as well as during in-orbit servicing and active debris removal
operations. The machine learning approach uses time series clustering together
with an optimised actuation sequence generated by reinforcement learning to
facilitate distinguishing among different inertial parameter sets. The
performance of the proposed strategy is assessed against the case of a
multi-satellite deployment system showing that the algorithm is resilient
towards common disturbances in such kinds of operations.</p></br>
