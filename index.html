experts, and the process is both complex and time-consuming. This reliance on
manual inspection often leads to inefficiencies and constrains the ability to
scale for widespread exoplanet detection, ultimately hindering discovery rates.
To address the limits of traditional microlensing event vetting, we have
developed LensNet, a machine learning pipeline specifically designed to
distinguish legitimate microlensing events from false positives caused by
instrumental artifacts, such as pixel bleed trails and diffraction spikes. Our
system operates in conjunction with a preliminary algorithm that detects
increasing trends in flux. These flagged instances are then passed to LensNet
for further classification, allowing for timely alerts and follow-up
observations. Tailored for the multi-observatory setup of the Korea
Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and trained on a rich dataset of
manually classified events, LensNet is optimized for early detection and
warning of microlensing occurrences, enabling astronomers to organize follow-up
observations promptly. The internal model of the pipeline employs a
multi-branch Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture that evaluates
time-series flux data with contextual information, including sky background,
the full width at half maximum of the target star, flux errors, PSF quality
flags, and air mass for each observation. We demonstrate a classification
accuracy above 87.5%, and anticipate further improvements as we expand our
training set and continue to refine the algorithm.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06532v1"><h2>Determination of galaxy photometric redshifts using Conditional
  Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs)</h2></a>Authors:  M. Garcia-Fernandez</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, cs.AI</br><p>Accurate and reliable photometric redshifts determination is one of the key
aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric
redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning
and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of
galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are determined. On this paper,
we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of
galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). Proposed
CGAN implementation, approaches photometric redshift determination as a
probabilistic regression, where instead of determining a single value for the
estimated redshift of the galaxy, a full probability density is computed. The
methodology proposed, is tested with data from Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 data
and compared with other existing algorithm such as a Random Forest regressor.</p></br>
