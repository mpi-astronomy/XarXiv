  orbiting around stars from its transit light curve using deep learning</h2></a>Authors:  Ushasi Bhowmick, Shivam Kumaran</br>Comments: 16 pages, 17 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Characterizing the geometry of an object orbiting around a star from its
transit light curve is a powerful tool to uncover various complex phenomena.
This problem is inherently ill-posed, since similar or identical light curves
can be produced by multiple different shapes. In this study, we investigate the
extent to which the features of a shape can be embedded in a transit light
curve. We generate a library of two-dimensional random shapes and simulate
their transit light curves with light curve simulator, Yuti. Each shape is
decomposed into a series of elliptical components expressed in the form of
Fourier coefficients that adds increasingly diminishing perturbations to an
ideal ellipse. We train deep neural networks to predict these Fourier
coefficients directly from simulated light curves. Our results demonstrate that
the neural network can successfully reconstruct the low-order ellipses, which
describe overall shape, orientation and large-scale perturbations. For higher
order ellipses the scale is successfully determined but the inference of
eccentricity and orientation is limited, demonstrating the extent of shape
information in the light curve. We explore the impact of non-convex shape
features in reconstruction, and show its dependence on shape orientation. The
level of reconstruction achieved by the neural network underscores the utility
of using light curves as a means to extract geometric information from
transiting systems.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17645v1"><h2>RAVEN: RAnking and Validation of ExoplaNets</h2></a>Authors:  Andreas Hadjigeorghiou, David J. Armstrong, Kaiming Cui, Marina Lafarga Magro, Luis Agustín Nieto, Rodrigo F. Díaz, Lauren Doyle, Vedad Kunovac</br>Comments: Submitted to MNRAS. Comments from the community are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We present RAVEN, a newly developed vetting and validation pipeline for TESS
exoplanet candidates. The pipeline employs a Bayesian framework to derive the
posterior probability of a candidate being a planet against a set of False
Positive (FP) scenarios, through the use of a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree
and a Gaussian Process classifier, trained on comprehensive synthetic training
sets of simulated planets and 8 astrophysical FP scenarios injected into TESS
lightcurves. These training sets allow large scale candidate vetting and
performance verification against individual FP scenarios. A Non-Simulated FP
training set consisting of real TESS candidates caused primarily by stellar
variability and systematic noise is also included. The machine learning derived
probabilities are combined with scenario specific prior probabilities,
including the candidates' positional probabilities, to compute the final
posterior probabilities. Candidates with a planetary posterior probability
greater than 99% against each FP scenario and whose implied planetary radius is
less than 8$R_{\oplus}$ are considered to be statistically validated by the
pipeline. In this first version, the pipeline has been developed for candidates
with a lightcurve released from the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre,
an orbital period between 0.5 and 16 days and a transit depth greater than
300ppm. The pipeline obtained area-under-curve (AUC) scores > 97% on all FP
scenarios and > 99% on all but one. Testing on an independent external sample
of 1361 pre-classified TOIs, the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 91%,
demonstrating its effectiveness for automated ranking of TESS candidates. For a
probability threshold of 0.9 the pipeline reached a precision of 97% with a
recall score of 66% on these TOIs. The RAVEN pipeline is publicly released as a
cloud-hosted app, making it easily accessible to the community.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14472v1"><h2>H-Alpha Anomalyzer: An Explainable Anomaly Detector for Solar H-Alpha
  Observations</h2></a>Authors:  Mahsa Khazaei, Azim Ahmadzadeh, Alexei Pevtsov, Luca Bertello, Alexander Pevtsov</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR</br><p>The plethora of space-borne and ground-based observatories has provided
astrophysicists with an unprecedented volume of data, which can only be
processed at scale using advanced computing algorithms. Consequently, ensuring
the quality of data fed into machine learning (ML) models is critical. The
H$\alpha$ observations from the GONG network represent one such data stream,
producing several observations per minute, 24/7, since 2010. In this study, we
introduce a lightweight (non-ML) anomaly-detection algorithm, called H-Alpha
Anomalyzer, designed to identify anomalous observations based on user-defined
criteria. Unlike many black-box algorithms, our approach highlights exactly
which regions triggered the anomaly flag and quantifies the corresponding
anomaly likelihood. For our comparative analysis, we also created and released
a dataset of 2,000 observations, equally divided between anomalous and
non-anomalous cases. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model not only
outperforms existing methods but also provides explainability, enabling
qualitative evaluation by domain experts.</p></br>
