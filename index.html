Armstrong, Kaiming Cui, Marina Lafarga Magro, Luis Agustín Nieto, Rodrigo F. Díaz, Lauren Doyle, Vedad Kunovac</br>Comments: Submitted to MNRAS. Comments from the community are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We present RAVEN, a newly developed vetting and validation pipeline for TESS
exoplanet candidates. The pipeline employs a Bayesian framework to derive the
posterior probability of a candidate being a planet against a set of False
Positive (FP) scenarios, through the use of a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree
and a Gaussian Process classifier, trained on comprehensive synthetic training
sets of simulated planets and 8 astrophysical FP scenarios injected into TESS
lightcurves. These training sets allow large scale candidate vetting and
performance verification against individual FP scenarios. A Non-Simulated FP
training set consisting of real TESS candidates caused primarily by stellar
variability and systematic noise is also included. The machine learning derived
probabilities are combined with scenario specific prior probabilities,
including the candidates' positional probabilities, to compute the final
posterior probabilities. Candidates with a planetary posterior probability
greater than 99% against each FP scenario and whose implied planetary radius is
less than 8$R_{\oplus}$ are considered to be statistically validated by the
pipeline. In this first version, the pipeline has been developed for candidates
with a lightcurve released from the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre,
an orbital period between 0.5 and 16 days and a transit depth greater than
300ppm. The pipeline obtained area-under-curve (AUC) scores > 97% on all FP
scenarios and > 99% on all but one. Testing on an independent external sample
of 1361 pre-classified TOIs, the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 91%,
demonstrating its effectiveness for automated ranking of TESS candidates. For a
probability threshold of 0.9 the pipeline reached a precision of 97% with a
recall score of 66% on these TOIs. The RAVEN pipeline is publicly released as a
cloud-hosted app, making it easily accessible to the community.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18214v1"><h2>Automatic Classification of Magnetic Chirality of Solar Filaments from
  H-Alpha Observations</h2></a>Authors:  Alexis Chalmers, Azim Ahmadzadeh</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.AI</br><p>In this study, we classify the magnetic chirality of solar filaments from
H-Alpha observations using state-of-the-art image classification models. We
establish the first reproducible baseline for solar filament chirality
classification on the MAGFiLO dataset. The MAGFiLO dataset contains over 10,000
manually-annotated filaments from GONG H-Alpha observations, making it the
largest dataset for filament detection and classification to date. Prior
studies relied on much smaller datasets, which limited their generalizability
and comparability. We fine-tuned several pre-trained, image classification
architectures, including ResNet, WideResNet, ResNeXt, and ConvNeXt, and also
applied data augmentation and per-class loss weights to optimize the models.
Our best model, ConvNeXtBase, achieves a per-class accuracy of 0.69 for left
chirality filaments and $0.73$ for right chirality filaments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18444v1"><h2>Complexity-entropy analysis of solar photospheric turbulence: Hinode
  images of magnetic and Poynting fluxes</h2></a>Authors:  Abraham C. -L. Chian, Haroldo V. Ribeiro, Erico L. Rempel, Rodrigo A. Miranda, Luis B. Rubio, Milan Gošić, Breno Raphaldini, Yasuhito Narita</br>Comments: 4 two-column pages, 3 figures, supplementary information; accepted
  for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, physics.data-an, physics.space-ph</br><p>The spatiotemporal inhomogeneous-homogeneous transition in the dynamics and
structures of solar photospheric turbulence is studied by applying the
complexity-entropy analysis to Hinode images of a vortical region of
supergranular junctions in the quiet Sun. During a period of supergranular
vortex expansion of 37.5 min, the spatiotemporal dynamics of the line-of-sight
magnetic field and the horizontal electromagnetic energy flux display the
characteristics of inverse turbulent cascade, evidenced by the formation of a
large magnetic coherent structure via the merger of two small magnetic elements
trapped by a long-duration vortex. Both magnetic and Poynting fluxes exhibit an
admixture of chaos and stochasticity in the complexity-entropy plane, involving
a temporal transition from low to high complexity and a temporal transition
from high to low entropy during the period of vortex expansion, consistent with
Hinode observations.</p></br>
