  Background in Pulsar Timing Arrays</h2></a>Authors:  M. Alakhras, S. M. S. Movahed</br>Comments: 29 pages, 15 figures, 1 table. Comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an, stat.CO</br><p>The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) reveals valuable
information about its origin and the Universe. The pulsar timing arrays (PTAs)
are suitable indicators for detecting SGWB within the nano-Hertz frequency
range. In this work, we propose a graph-based method implemented on the pulsar
timing residuals (PTRs) for SGWB detection and examining uncertainties of its
parameters. We construct a correlation graph with pulsars as its nodes, and
analyze the graph-based summary statistics, which include topological and
geometrical characteristics, for identifying SGWB in real and synthetic
datasets. The effect of the number of pulsars, the observation time span, and
the strength of the SGWB on the graph-based feature vector is evaluated. Our
results demonstrate that the merit feature vector for common signal detection
consists of the average clustering coefficient and the edge weight fluctuation.
The SGWB detection conducted after the observation of a common signal and then
exclusion of non-Hellings \& Downs templates is performed by the second
cumulant of edge weight for angular separation thresholds $\bar{\zeta}\gtrsim
40^{\circ}$. The lowest detectable value of SGWB strain amplitude utilizing our
graph-based measures at the current PTAs sensitivity is $A_{\rm SGWB}\gtrsim
1.2\times 10^{-15}$. Fisher forecasts confirmed that the uncertainty levels of
$\log_{10} A_{\rm SGWB}$ and spectral index reach $2.2\%$ and $28.3\%$,
respectively, at $2\sigma$ confidence interval. Evidence for an SGWB at the
$3\sigma$ level is obtained by applying our graph-based method to the NANOGrav
15-year dataset.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23901v1"><h2>Interpreting deep learning-based stellar mass estimation via causal
  analysis and mutual information decomposition</h2></a>Authors:  Wei Zhang, Qiufan Lin, Yuan-Sen Ting, Shupei Chen, Hengxin Ruan, Song Li, Yifan Wang</br>Comments: Accepted at Astronomy & Astrophysics; 23 + 12 pages; 8 + 16 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, cs.AI, cs.CV</br><p>End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are
powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the
absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the
associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the
information additional to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes
to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable
further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy
properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at
interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two
interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information
decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables
beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the
multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of
different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE),
we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for
image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep
learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more
data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations
and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24134v1"><h2>ASTROCO: Self-Supervised Conformer-Style Transformers for Light-Curve
  Embeddings</h2></a>Authors:  Antony Tan, Pavlos Protopapas, Martina Cádiz-Leyton, Guillermo Cabrera-Vives, Cristobal Donoso-Oliva, Ignacio Becker</br>Comments: Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning and the
  Physical Sciences (ML4PS), camera-ready version in progress</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>We present AstroCo, a Conformer-style encoder for irregular stellar light
curves. By combining attention with depthwise convolutions and gating, AstroCo
captures both global dependencies and local features. On MACHO R-band, AstroCo
outperforms Astromer v1 and v2, yielding 70 percent and 61 percent lower error
respectively and a relative macro-F1 gain of about 7 percent, while producing
embeddings that transfer effectively to few-shot classification. These results
highlight AstroCo's potential as a strong and label-efficient foundation for
time-domain astronomy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.26567v1"><h2>AI-assisted Advanced Propellant Development for Electric Propulsion</h2></a>Authors:  Angel Pan Du, Miguel Arana-Catania, Enric Grustan Gutiérrez</br>Comments: 23 pages, 10 figures, 5 tables. Journal of Electric Propulsion</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG, physics.space-ph</br><p>Artificial Intelligence algorithms are introduced in this work as a tool to
predict the performance of new chemical compounds as alternative propellants
for electric propulsion, focusing on predicting their ionisation
characteristics and fragmentation patterns. The chemical properties and
structure of the compounds are encoded using a chemical fingerprint, and the
training datasets are extracted from the NIST WebBook. The AI-predicted
ionisation energy and minimum appearance energy have a mean relative error of
6.87% and 7.99%, respectively, and a predicted ion mass with a 23.89% relative
error. In the cases of full mass spectra due to electron ionisation, the
predictions have a cosine similarity of 0.6395 and align with the top 10 most
similar mass spectra in 78% of instances within a 30 Da range.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24327v1"><h2>Inferring Cosmological Parameters with Evidential Physics-Informed
  Neural Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Hai Siong Tan</br>Comments: 25 pages, 11 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, gr-qc</br><p>We examine the use of a novel variant of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to
predict cosmological parameters from recent supernovae and baryon acoustic
oscillations (BAO) datasets. Our machine learning framework generates
uncertainty estimates for target variables and the inferred unknown parameters
of the underlying PDE descriptions. Built upon a hybrid of the principles of
Evidential Deep Learning, Physics-Informed Neural Networks, Bayesian Neural
Networks and Gaussian Processes, our model enables learning of the posterior
distribution of the unknown PDE parameters through standard gradient-descent
based training. We apply our model to an up-to-date BAO dataset (Bousis et al.
2024) calibrated with the CMB-inferred sound horizon, and the Pantheon$+$ Sne
Ia distances (Scolnic et al. 2018), examining the relative effectiveness and
mutual consistency among the standard $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM and $\Lambda_s$CDM
models. Unlike previous results arising from the standard approach of
minimizing an appropriate $\chi^2$ function, the posterior distributions for
parameters in various models trained purely on Pantheon$+$ data were found to
be largely contained within the $2\sigma$ contours of their counterparts
trained on BAO data. Their posterior medians for $h_0$ were within about
$2\sigma$ of one another, indicating that our machine learning-guided approach
provides a different measure of the Hubble tension.</p></br>
