terms of computing power. These synthetic planetary systems can however provide
access to correlations, as predicted in a given numerical framework, between
the properties of planets in the same system. Such correlations can, in return,
be used in order to guide and prioritize observational campaigns aiming at
discovering some types of planets, as Earth-like planets. Our goal is to
develop a generative model which is capable of capturing correlations and
statistical relationships between planets in the same system. Such a model,
trained on the Bern model, offers the possibility to generate large number of
synthetic planetary systems with little computational cost, that can be used,
for example, to guide observational campaigns. Our generative model is based on
the transformer architecture which is well-known to efficiently capture
correlations in sequences and is at the basis of all modern Large Language
Models. To assess the validity of the generative model, we perform visual and
statistical comparisons, as well as a machine learning driven tests. Finally,
as a use case example, we consider the TOI-469 system, in which we aim at
predicting the possible properties of planets c and d, based on the properties
of planet b (the first that has been detected). We show using different
comparison methods that the properties of systems generated by our model are
very similar to the ones of the systems computed directly by the Bern model. We
also show in the case of the TOI-469 system, that using the generative model
allows to predict the properties of planets not yet observed, based on the
properties of the already observed planet. We provide our model to the
community on our website www.ai4exoplanets.com.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06445v1"><h2>Learning to detect continuous gravitational waves: an open data-analysis
  competition</h2></a>Authors:  Rodrigo Tenorio, Michael J. Williams, Joseph Bayley, Christopher Messenger, Maggie Demkin, Walter Reade, Kaggle Competitors</br>Comments: 31 pages, 5 + 2 figures, comments welcome</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an, physics.soc-ph</br><p>We report results of a public data-analysis challenge, hosted on the open
data-science platform Kaggle, to detect simulated continuous gravitational-wave
signals. These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain
undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a
population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data
matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more
than 1,000 participants to develop realistic CW search algorithms. We describe
the top 10 approaches and discuss their applicability as a pre-processing step
compared to standard CW-search approaches. For the competition's dataset, we
find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of
magnitude at a 2% dismissal probability. Additionally, the competition drove
the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines and extended
CW-inspired statistics to other domains. We release the associated dataset,
which constitutes the first open standardized benchmark for CW detection, to
enable reproducible method comparisons and to encourage further developments
toward the first detection of these elusive signals.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.06208v1"><h2>Repeating vs. Non-Repeating FRBs: A Deep Learning Approach To
  Morphological Characterization</h2></a>Authors:  Bikash Kharel, Emmanuel Fonseca, Charanjot Brar, Afrokk Khan, Lluis Mas-Ribas, Swarali Shivraj Patil, Paul Scholz, Seth Robert Siegel, David C. Stenning</br>Comments: 26 pages, 17 figures, submitted to ApJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.HE</br>All Categories: astro-ph.HE, cs.LG</br><p>We present a deep learning approach to classify fast radio bursts (FRBs)
based purely on morphology as encoded on recorded dynamic spectrum from
CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We implemented transfer learning with a pretrained
ConvNext architecture, exploiting its powerful feature extraction ability.
ConvNext was adapted to classify dedispersed dynamic spectra (which we treat as
images) of the FRBs into one of the two sub-classes, i.e., repeater and
non-repeater, based on their various temporal and spectral properties and
relation between the sub-pulse structures. Additionally, we also used
mathematical model representation of the total intensity data to interpret the
deep learning model. Upon fine-tuning the pretrained ConvNext on the FRB
spectrograms, we were able to achieve high classification metrics while
substantially reducing training time and computing power as compared to
training a deep learning model from scratch with random weights and biases
without any feature extraction ability. Importantly, our results suggest that
the morphological differences between CHIME repeating and non-repeating events
persist in Catalog 2 and the deep learning model leveraged these differences
for classification. The fine-tuned deep learning model can be used for
inference, which enables us to predict whether an FRB's morphology resembles
that of repeaters or non-repeaters. Such inferences may become increasingly
significant when trained on larger data sets that will exist in the near
future.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.07265v1"><h2>Setting Limits on Blazar-Boosted Dark Matter with Xenon-based Detectors</h2></a>Authors:  Erin Barillier, Laura Manenti, Knut Mora, Paolo Padovani, Isaac Sarnoff, Yongheng Xu, Bjorn Penning, Francesco Arneodo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.HE</br>All Categories: astro-ph.HE, hep-ex, physics.data-an</br><p>Dual-phase xenon time projection chambers achieve optimal sensitivity for
dark matter in the $10$--$1000~\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass range, but sub-GeV dark
matter particles lack sufficient energy to produce nuclear recoils above
detection thresholds in these detectors. Blazar-boosted dark matter offers a
way to overcome this limitation: relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei
can accelerate light dark matter in their host-galaxy halos to energies capable
of producing detectable nuclear recoil signals in xenon-based detectors on
Earth. We present the first blazar-boosted dark matter search incorporating
detector response modeling, using public data from XENON1T and LZ for the
blazar TXS~0506+056. We model dark matter--proton scattering in the jet
environment, covering the full process from jet acceleration to detector
response. We explore how the host-galaxy dark matter density profile impacts
our analysis. Using XENON1T data, we exclude dark matter--nucleon cross
sections for $m_\chi \sim 1~\mathrm{MeV}$ in the range $5.8\times
10^{-31}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 6.3\times
10^{-29}~\mathrm{cm^2}$, and using LZ EFT searches we constrain $9.9\times
10^{-32}~\mathrm{cm^2} \lesssim \sigma_{\chi n} \lesssim 2.5\times
10^{-28}~\mathrm{cm^2}$. Our results show that astrophysical uncertainties,
especially the dark matter density profile near the supermassive black hole,
set the primary limitation on the sensitivity rather than detector systematics.
These findings highlight blazar-boosted dark matter as a promising probe of
light dark matter and motivate further astrophysical modeling.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05724v1"><h2>Robust variational neural posterior estimation for simulation-based
  inference</h2></a>Authors:  Matthew O'Callaghan, Kaisey S. Mandel, Gerry Gilmore</br>Comments: Main text: 16 pages, 6 figures</br>Primary Category: stat.ML</br>All Categories: stat.ML, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful
simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian
inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have
demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately
represents the underlying data generative process (GDP), recent work has shown
that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses
a significant problem for their use on real-world problems, due to simulators
always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we
introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which
addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the
simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We
test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from
astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a
data-driven manner without adopting tunable hyperparameters or priors governing
the misspecification.</p></br>
