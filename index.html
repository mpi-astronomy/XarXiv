language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This
dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual
Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical
topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical
subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment
in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to
4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we
observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar
score in this particular astronomy benchmark. Open-source models have rapidly
improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with
some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across
topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in
exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related
questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data,
limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This
pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with
regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data
diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains.
Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations
above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly
underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights
models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy. The
rapid progress observed suggests that LLM-driven research in astronomy may
become feasible in the near future.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11659v1"><h2>Magnetogram-to-Magnetogram: Generative Forecasting of Solar Evolution</h2></a>Authors:  Francesco Pio Ramunno, Hyun-Jin Jeong, Stefan Hackstein, Andr√© Csillaghy, Svyatoslav Voloshynovskiy, Manolis K. Georgoulis</br>Comments: Conference paper accepted for an oral presentation to the ESA SPAICE
  CONFERENCE 17 19 September 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Investigating the solar magnetic field is crucial to understand the physical
processes in the solar interior as well as their effects on the interplanetary
environment. We introduce a novel method to predict the evolution of the solar
line-of-sight (LoS) magnetogram using image-to-image translation with Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs). Our approach combines "computer science
metrics" for image quality and "physics metrics" for physical accuracy to
evaluate model performance. The results indicate that DDPMs are effective in
maintaining the structural integrity, the dynamic range of solar magnetic
fields, the magnetic flux and other physical features such as the size of the
active regions, surpassing traditional persistence models, also in flaring
situation. We aim to use deep learning not only for visualisation but as an
integrative and interactive tool for telescopes, enhancing our understanding of
unexpected physical events like solar flares. Future studies will aim to
integrate more diverse solar data to refine the accuracy and applicability of
our generative model.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12974v1"><h2>False positives for gravitational lensing: the gravitational-wave
  perspective</h2></a>Authors:  David Keitel</br>Comments: 14 pages, 2 figures, submitted to Philosophical Transactions of the
  Royal Society special issue on Multi-Messenger Gravitational Lensing</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, physics.data-an</br><p>For the first detection of a novel astrophysical phenomenon, scientific
standards are particularly high. Especially in a multi-messenger context, there
are also opportunity costs to follow-up observations on any detection claims.
So in searching for the still elusive lensed gravitational waves, care needs to
be taken in controlling false positives. In particular, many methods for
identifying strong lensing rely on some form of parameter similarity or
waveform consistency, which under rapidly growing catalog sizes can expose them
to false positives from coincident but unlensed events if proper care is not
taken. And searches for waveform deformations in all lensing regimes are
subject to degeneracies we need to mitigate between lensing, intrinsic
parameters, insufficiently modelled effects such as orbital eccentricity, or
even deviations from general relativity. Robust lensing studies also require
understanding and mitigating glitches and non-stationarities in the detector
data. This article reviews sources of possible false positives (and their flip
side: false negatives) in gravitational-wave lensing searches and the main
approaches the community is pursuing to mitigate them.</p></br>
