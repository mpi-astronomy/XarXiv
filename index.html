scientific domains, motivating our exploration of their potential in solar
physics. In this paper, we present Solaris, the first foundation model for
forecasting the Sun's atmosphere. We leverage 13 years of full-disk,
multi-wavelength solar imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, spanning a
complete solar cycle, to pre-train Solaris for 12-hour interval forecasting.
Solaris is built on a large-scale 3D Swin Transformer architecture with 109
million parameters. We demonstrate Solaris' ability to generalize by
fine-tuning on a low-data regime using a single wavelength (1700 {\AA}), that
was not included in pre-training, outperforming models trained from scratch on
this specific wavelength. Our results indicate that Solaris can effectively
capture the complex dynamics of the solar atmosphere and transform solar
forecasting.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14748v1"><h2>Cosmological Analysis with Calibrated Neural Quantile Estimation and
  Approximate Simulators</h2></a>Authors:  He Jia</br>Comments: 5+4 pages, 5+3 figures, to be submitted, comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>A major challenge in extracting information from current and upcoming surveys
of cosmological Large-Scale Structure (LSS) is the limited availability of
computationally expensive high-fidelity simulations. We introduce Neural
Quantile Estimation (NQE), a new Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method that
leverages a large number of approximate simulations for training and a small
number of high-fidelity simulations for calibration. This approach guarantees
an unbiased posterior and achieves near-optimal constraining power when the
approximate simulations are reasonably accurate. As a proof of concept, we
demonstrate that cosmological parameters can be inferred at field level from
projected 2-dim dark matter density maps up to $k_{\rm max}\sim1.5\,h$/Mpc at
$z=0$ by training on $\sim10^4$ Particle-Mesh (PM) simulations with transfer
function correction and calibrating with $\sim10^2$ Particle-Particle (PP)
simulations. The calibrated posteriors closely match those obtained by directly
training on $\sim10^4$ expensive PP simulations, but at a fraction of the
computational cost. Our method offers a practical and scalable framework for
SBI of cosmological LSS, enabling precise inference across vast volumes and
down to small scales.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13915v1"><h2>An accurate solar axions ray-tracing response of BabyIAXO</h2></a>Authors:  S. Ahyoune, K. Altenmueller, I. Antolin, S.

(IAXO) to be hosted at DESY. Its primary goal is the detection of solar axions
following the axion helioscope technique. Axions are converted into photons in
a large magnet that is pointing to the sun. The resulting X-rays are focused by
appropriate X-ray optics and detected by sensitive low-background detectors
placed at the focal spot. The aim of this article is to provide an accurate
quantitative description of the different components (such as the magnet,
optics, and X-ray detectors) involved in the detection of axions. Our efforts
have focused on developing robust and integrated software tools to model these
helioscope components, enabling future assessments of modifications or upgrades
to any part of the IAXO axion helioscope and evaluating the potential impact on
the experiment's sensitivity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the
application of these tools by presenting a precise signal calculation and
response analysis of BabyIAXO's sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling.
Though focusing on the Primakoff solar flux component, our virtual helioscope
model can be used to test different production mechanisms, allowing for direct
comparisons within a unified framework.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16556v1"><h2>Anomaly Detection and RFI Classification with Unsupervised Learning in
  Narrowband Radio Technosignature Searches</h2></a>Authors:  Ben Jacobson-Bell, Steve Croft, Carmen Choza, Alex Andersson, Daniel Bautista, Vishal Gajjar, Matthew Lebofsky, David H. E. MacMahon, Caleb Painter, Andrew P. V. Siemion</br>Comments: 20 pages, 14 figures, submitted to AJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The search for radio technosignatures is an anomaly detection problem:
candidate signals represent needles of interest in the proverbial haystack of
radio-frequency interference (RFI). Current search frameworks find an enormity
of false-positive signals, especially in large surveys, requiring manual
follow-up to a sometimes prohibitive degree. Unsupervised learning provides an
algorithmic way to winnow the most anomalous signals from the chaff, as well as
group together RFI signals that bear morphological similarities. We present
GLOBULAR (Grouping Low-frequency Observations By Unsupervised Learning After
Reduction) clustering, a signal processing method that uses HDBSCAN to reduce
the false-positive rate and isolate outlier signals for further analysis. When
combined with a standard narrowband signal detection and spatial filtering
pipeline, such as turboSETI, GLOBULAR clustering offers significant
improvements in the false-positive rate over the standard pipeline alone,
suggesting dramatic potential for the amelioration of manual follow-up
requirements for future large surveys. By removing RFI signals in regions of
high spectral occupancy, GLOBULAR clustering may also enable the detection of
signals missed by the standard pipeline. We benchmark our method against the
Choza et al. (2024) turboSETI-only search of 97 nearby galaxies at L-band,
demonstrating a false-positive hit reduction rate of 93.1% and a false-positive
event reduction rate of 99.3%.</p></br>
