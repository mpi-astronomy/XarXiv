  quantification</h2></a>Authors:  Matthijs Mars, Tob√≠as I. Liaudat, Jessica J. Whitney, Marta M. Betcke, Jason D. McEwen</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>With the rise of large radio interferometric telescopes, particularly the
SKA, there is a growing demand for computationally efficient image
reconstruction techniques. Existing reconstruction methods, such as the CLEAN
algorithm or proximal optimisation approaches, are iterative in nature,
necessitating a large amount of compute. These methods either provide no
uncertainty quantification or require large computational overhead to do so.
Learned reconstruction methods have shown promise in providing efficient and
high quality reconstruction. In this article we explore the use of generative
neural networks that enable efficient approximate sampling of the posterior
distribution for high quality reconstructions with uncertainty quantification.
Our RI-GAN framework, builds on the regularised conditional generative
adversarial network (rcGAN) framework by integrating a gradient U-Net (GU-Net)
architecture - a hybrid reconstruction model that embeds the measurement
operator directly into the network. This framework uses Wasserstein GANs to
improve training stability in combination with regularisation terms that combat
mode collapse, which are typical problems for conditional GANs. This approach
takes as input the dirty image and the point spread function (PSF) of the
observation and provides efficient, high-quality image reconstructions that are
robust to varying visibility coverages, generalises to images with an increased
dynamic range, and provides informative uncertainty quantification. Our methods
provide a significant step toward computationally efficient, scalable, and
uncertainty-aware imaging for next-generation radio telescopes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20378v1"><h2>Set-based Implicit Likelihood Inference of Galaxy Cluster Mass</h2></a>Authors:  Bonny Y. Wang, Leander Thiele</br>Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures; accepted as a spotlight talk at ICML-colocated
  ML4Astro 2025 workshop</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.CO</br><p>We present a set-based machine learning framework that infers posterior
distributions of galaxy cluster masses from projected galaxy dynamics. Our
model combines Deep Sets and conditional normalizing flows to incorporate both
positional and velocity information of member galaxies to predict residual
corrections to the $M$-$\sigma$ relation for improved interpretability. Trained
on the Uchuu-UniverseMachine simulation, our approach significantly reduces
scatter and provides well-calibrated uncertainties across the full mass range
compared to traditional dynamical estimates.</p></br>
