It focuses on two concepts of understanding: intuition and causality, and
highlights three AI technologies: Transformers, chain-of-thought reasoning, and
multimodal processing. We anticipate that in principle AI could form
understanding, with these technologies representing promising advancements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.19064v1"><h2>Machine Learning in Gamma Astronomy</h2></a>Authors:  A. P.

astrophysical events, such as binary black hole mergers. However, their high
sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure
these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called "glitches"
that can mimic astrophysical signals or mask their characteristics. Fast and
accurate reconstruction of both signals and glitches is crucial for reliable
scientific inference. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning
framework designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding
interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to
model the inherent noise distribution of GW interferometers, following
conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short
time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of
the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction. Our approach achieves
superior generalization capabilities for arbitrary signals and glitches
compared to methods that directly map inputs to the clean training waveforms.
We validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1)
reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2)
comparing performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3)
analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective
glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. DeepExtractor achieves a median
mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep
learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch
recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one
glitch sample in approx. 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's
processing time of approx. one hour per glitch.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17936v1"><h2>Aspects of Spatially-Correlated Random Fields: Extreme-Value Statistics
  and Clustering Properties</h2></a>Authors:  Ka Hei Choi, James Creswell, Florian Kuhnel, Dominik J. Schwarz</br>Comments: 7 pages, 6 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>Rare events of large-scale spatially-correlated exponential random fields are
studied. The influence of spatial correlations on clustering and non-sphericity
is investigated. The size of the performed simulations permits to study
beyond-$7.5$-sigma events ($1$ in $10^{13}$). As an application, this allows to
resolve individual Hubble patches which fulfill the condition for primordial
black hole formation. It is argued that their mass spectrum is drastically
altered due to co-collapse of clustered overdensities as well as the mutual
threshold-lowering through the latter. Furthermore, the corresponding
non-sphericities imply possibly large changes in the initial black hole spin
distribution.</p></br>
