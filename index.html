  Small Satellite Technologies</h2></a>Authors:  Dishanand Jayeprokash, Julia Gonski</br>Comments: 10 pages, 6 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Small satellite technologies have enhanced the potential and feasibility of
geodesic missions, through simplification of design and decreased costs
allowing for more frequent launches. On-satellite data acquisition systems can
benefit from the implementation of machine learning (ML), for better
performance and greater efficiency on tasks such as image processing or feature
extraction. This work presents convolutional autoencoders for implementation on
the payload of small satellites, designed to achieve dual functionality of data
compression for more efficient off-satellite transmission, and at-source
anomaly detection to inform satellite data-taking. This capability is
demonstrated for a use case of disaster monitoring using aerial image datasets
of the African continent, offering avenues for both novel ML-based approaches
in small satellite applications along with the expansion of space technology
and artificial intelligence in Africa.</p></br>
