  complement 3D GCM grid simulations</h2></a>Authors:  Alexander Plaschzug, Amit Reza, Ludmila Carone, Sebastian Gernjak, Christiane Helling</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>With the development of ever-improving telescopes capable of observing
exoplanet atmospheres in greater detail and number, there is a growing demand
for enhanced 3D climate models to support and help interpret observational data
from space missions like CHEOPS, TESS, JWST, PLATO, and Ariel. However, the
computationally intensive and time-consuming nature of general circulation
models (GCMs) poses significant challenges in simulating a wide range of
exoplanetary atmospheres. This study aims to determine whether machine learning
(ML) algorithms can be used to predict the 3D temperature and wind structure of
arbitrary tidally-locked gaseous exoplanets in a range of planetary parameters.
A new 3D GCM grid with 60 inflated hot Jupiters orbiting A, F, G, K, and M-type
host stars modelled with Exorad has been introduced. A dense neural network
(DNN) and a decision tree algorithm (XGBoost) are trained on this grid to
predict local gas temperatures along with horizontal and vertical winds. To
ensure the reliability and quality of the ML model predictions, WASP-121 b,
HATS-42 b, NGTS-17 b, WASP-23 b, and NGTS-1 b-like planets, which are all
targets for PLATO observation, are selected and modelled with ExoRad and the
two ML methods as test cases. The DNN predictions for the gas temperatures are
to such a degree that the calculated spectra agree within 32 ppm for all but
one planet, for which only one single HCN feature reaches a 100 ppm difference.
The developed ML emulators can reliably predict the complete 3D temperature
field of an inflated warm to ultra-hot tidally locked Jupiter around A to
M-type host stars. It provides a fast tool to complement and extend traditional
GCM grids for exoplanet ensemble studies. The quality of the predictions is
such that no or minimal effects on the gas phase chemistry, hence on the cloud
formation and transmission spectra, are to be expected.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11938v1"><h2>Wavelets for power spectral density estimation of gravitational wave
  data</h2></a>Authors:  Jin-Bao Zhu, Chao-Wan-Zhen Wang, Guo-Qing Huang, Fu-Wen Shu</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Power spectral density (PSD) estimation is a critical step in gravitational
wave (GW) detectors data analysis. The Welch method is a typical non-parametric
spectral estimation approach that estimates the PSD of stationary noise by
averaging periodograms of several time segments, or by taking the median of
periodograms to adapt to non-stationary noise. In this work, we propose a
wavelet-based approach for fast PSD estimation of both stationary and
non-stationary noise. For stationary noise, we apply wavelet smoothing to the
periodogram, avoiding the segmentation step in the Welch method, and enabling
PSD estimates with high frequency resolution and low variance. The wavelet
smoothing PSD outperforms Welch PSD in matched filtering and parameter
estimation. For non-stationary noise, we estimate the PSD by taking the median
of wavelet packet coefficients in each frequency bin, which offers greater
robustness than the traditional median periodogram method. This work introduces
a new PSD estimation approach for GW data analysis and expands the application
of wavelet methods in this field.</p></br>
