  augmented equivariant bootstrap: Application to radio interferometry</h2></a>Authors:  Mostafa Cherif, Tobías I. Liaudat, Jonathan Kern, Christophe Kervazo, Jérôme Bobin</br>Comments: 13 pages, 7 figures. Accepted at the Machine Learning and the
  Physical Sciences Workshop, NeurIPS 2024</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The advent of next-generation radio interferometers like the Square Kilometer
Array promises to revolutionise our radio astronomy observational capabilities.
The unprecedented volume of data these devices generate requires fast and
accurate image reconstruction algorithms to solve the ill-posed radio
interferometric imaging problem. Most state-of-the-art reconstruction methods
lack trustworthy and scalable uncertainty quantification, which is critical for
the rigorous scientific interpretation of radio observations. We propose an
unsupervised technique based on a conformalized version of a radio-augmented
equivariant bootstrapping method, which allows us to quantify uncertainties for
fast reconstruction methods. Noticeably, we rely on reconstructions from
ultra-fast unrolled algorithms. The proposed method brings more reliable
uncertainty estimations to our problem than existing alternatives.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23346v1"><h2>ASURA-FDPS-ML: Star-by-star Galaxy Simulations Accelerated by Surrogate
  Modeling for Supernova Feedback</h2></a>Authors:  Keiya Hirashima, Kana Moriwaki, Michiko S. Fujii, Yutaka Hirai, Takayuki R. Saitoh, Junnichiro Makino, Ulrich P. Steinwandel, Shirley Ho</br>Comments: 20 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables, submitted to ApJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>We introduce new high-resolution galaxy simulations accelerated by a
surrogate model that reduces the computation cost by approximately 75 percent.
Massive stars with a Zero Age Main Sequence mass of about 8 solar masses and
above explode as core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which play a critical role
in galaxy formation. The energy released by CCSNe is essential for regulating
star formation and driving feedback processes in the interstellar medium (ISM).
However, the short integration timesteps required for SNe feedback present
significant bottlenecks in star-by-star galaxy simulations that aim to capture
individual stellar dynamics and the inhomogeneous shell expansion of SNe within
the turbulent ISM. Our new framework combines direct numerical simulations and
surrogate modeling, including machine learning and Gibbs sampling. The star
formation history and the time evolution of outflow rates in the galaxy match
those obtained from resolved direct numerical simulations. Our new approach
achieves high-resolution fidelity while reducing computational costs,
effectively bridging the physical scale gap and enabling multi-scale
simulations.</p></br>
