  robustness in flyby observations with a rotating telescope</h2></a>Authors:  Takayuki Hosonuma, Takeshi Miyabara, Naoya Ozaki, Ko Ishibashi, Yuta Suzaki, Peng Hong, Masayuki Ohta, Takeshi Takashima</br>Comments: 19 pages, 25 figures, submitted to Acta Astronautica</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>DESTINY+ is an upcoming JAXA Epsilon medium-class mission to flyby multiple
asteroids including Phaethon. As an asteroid flyby observation instrument, a
telescope mechanically capable of single-axis rotation, named TCAP, is mounted
on the spacecraft to track and observe the target asteroids during flyby. As in
past flyby missions utilizing rotating telescopes, TCAP is also used as a
navigation camera for autonomous optical navigation during the closest-approach
phase. To mitigate the degradation of the navigation accuracy, past missions
performed calibration of the navigation camera's alignment before starting
optical navigation. However, such calibration requires significant operational
time to complete and imposes constraints on the operation sequence. From the
above background, the DESTINY+ team has studied the possibility of reducing
operational costs by allowing TCAP alignment errors to remain. This paper
describes an autonomous optical navigation algorithm robust to the misalignment
of rotating telescopes, proposed in this context. In the proposed method, the
misalignment of the telescope is estimated simultaneously with the spacecraft's
orbit relative to the flyby target. To deal with the nonlinearity between the
misalignment and the observation value, the proposed method utilizes the
unscented Kalman filter, instead of the extended Kalman filter widely used in
past studies. The proposed method was evaluated with numerical simulations on a
PC and with hardware-in-the-loop simulation, taking the Phaethon flyby in the
DESTINY+ mission as an example. The validation results suggest that the
proposed method can mitigate the misalignment-induced degradation of the
optical navigation accuracy with reasonable computational costs suited for
onboard computers.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01660v1"><h2>STRAUSS: Sonification Tools & Resources for Analysis Using Sound
  Synthesis</h2></a>Authors:  James W. Trayford, Samantha Youles, Chris Harrison, Rose Shepherd, Nicolas Bonne</br>Comments: 4 pages, linking to documentation on ReadTheDocs
  (https://strauss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Sonification, or conveying data using non-verbal audio, is a relatively niche
but growing approach for presenting data across multiple specialist domains
including astronomy, climate science, and beyond. The STRAUSS Python package
aims to provide such a tool, which builds upon previous approaches to provide a
powerful means to explore different ways of expressing data, with fine control
over the output audio and its format. STRAUSS is a free, open source (FOSS)
package, designed to allow flexible and effective sonification to be integrated
into data workflows, in analogy to widely used visualisation packages. The
remit of STRAUSS is broad; it is intended to be able to bridge between ad-hoc
solutions for sonifying very particular datasets, and highly technical
compositional and sound-design tools that are not optimised for sonification,
or may have a steep learning curve. The code offers a range of approaches to
sonification for a variety of contexts (e.g. science education, science
communication, technical data analysis, etc). To this end, STRAUSS is packaged
with a number of examples of different sonification approaches, and preset
configurations to support "low-barrier, high-ceiling" approach. STRAUSS has
been used to produce both educational resources and analysis tools.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02196v1"><h2>Orbit Determination through Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</h2></a>Authors:  Pedro K de Albuquerque, Andre R Kuroswiski, Annie S. Wu, Willer G. dos Santos, Paulo Costa</br>Comments: This paper was presented at the 2024 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics
  Specialist Conference, August 11-15, 2024, Broomfield, Colorado, USA</br>Primary Category: physics.ins-det</br>All Categories: physics.ins-det, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>This research explores the use of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation
as a reference signal for Initial Orbit Determination (IOD). By leveraging the
unique properties of CMB, this study introduces a novel method for estimating
spacecraft velocity and position with minimal reliance on pre-existing
environmental data, offering significant advantages for space missions
independent of Earth-specific conditions. Using Machine Learning (ML)
regression models, this approach demonstrates the capability to determine
velocity from CMB signals and subsequently determine the satellite's position.
The results indicate that CMB has the potential to enhance the autonomy and
flexibility of spacecraft operations.</p></br>
