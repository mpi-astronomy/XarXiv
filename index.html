  SOT/SP Observations</h2></a>Authors:  Jargalmaa Batmunkh, Yusuke Iida, Takayoshi Oba, Haruhisa Iijima</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR</br><p>The complex structure and extensive details of solar spectral data, combined
with a recent surge in volume, present significant processing challenges. To
address this, we propose a deep learning-based compression technique using deep
autoencoder (DAE) and 1D-convolutional autoencoder (CAE) models developed with
Hinode SOT/SP data. We focused on compressing Stokes I and V polarization
spectra from the quiet Sun, as well as from active regions, providing a novel
insight into comprehensive spectral analysis by incorporating spectra from
extreme magnetic fields. The results indicate that the CAE model outperforms
the DAE model in reconstructing Stokes profiles, demonstrating greater
robustness and achieving reconstruction errors around the observational noise
level. The proposed method has proven effective in compressing Stokes I and V
spectra from both the quiet Sun and active regions, highlighting its potential
for impactful applications in solar spectral analysis, such as detection of
unusual spectral signals.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10409v1"><h2>Design of Dedicated Tilt-to-Length Calibration Maneuvers for LISA</h2></a>Authors:  Henry Wegener, Sarah Paczkowski, Marie-Sophie Hartig, Martin Hewitson, Gerhard Heinzel, Gudrun Wanner</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an, physics.ins-det</br><p>Tilts of certain elements within a laser interferometer can undesirably
couple into measurements as a form of noise, known as tilt-to-length (TTL)
coupling. This TTL coupling is anticipated to be one of the primary noise
sources in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, after Time
Delay Interferometry (TDI) is applied. Despite the careful interferometer
design and calibration on the ground, TTL is likely to require in-flight
mitigation through post-processing subtraction to achieve the necessary
sensitivity. Past research has demonstrated TTL subtraction in simulations
through the estimation of 24 linear coupling coefficients using a noise
minimization approach. This paper investigates an approach based on performing
rotation maneuvers for estimating coupling coefficients with low uncertainties.
In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and optimal configurations of such
maneuvers to identify the most efficient solutions. We assess the efficacy of
TTL calibration maneuvers by modulating either the spacecraft attitude or the
Moving Optical Sub-Assembly (MOSA) yaw angle. We found that sinusoidal signals
with amplitudes of around 30 nrad and frequencies near 43 mHz are practical and
nearly optimal choices for such modulations. Employing different frequencies
generates uncorrelated signals, allowing for multiple maneuvers to be executed
simultaneously. Our simulations enable us to estimate the TTL coefficients with
precision below 15 um/rad (1-sigma, in free space) after a total maneuver time
of 20 minutes. The results are compared to the estimation uncertainties that
can be achieved without using maneuvers.</p></br>
