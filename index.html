  for Volume 64. This is the authors' version. Revisions and the final version
  will be available at https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/astro</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.HE, cs.AI</br><p>Deep learning has generated diverse perspectives in astronomy, with ongoing
discussions between proponents and skeptics motivating this review. We examine
how neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data
analytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities
through encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential
equations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond
training data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in
billions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and
expensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain
knowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding
models toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods
offer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural
architectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data
efficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network
structure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based
inference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian
distributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level
cosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale
neural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning
effective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance
large-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. -
Emerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation
models learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for
research automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical
applications.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11242v1"><h2>Analyzing Data Quality and Decay in Mega-Constellations: A
  Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach</h2></a>Authors:  Katarina Dyreby, Francisco Caldas, Cl√°udia Soares</br>Comments: 76th International Astronautical Congress</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>In the era of mega-constellations, the need for accurate and publicly
available information has become fundamental for satellite operators to
guarantee the safety of spacecrafts and the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space
environment. This study critically evaluates the accuracy and reliability of
publicly available ephemeris data for a LEO mega-constellation - Starlink. The
goal of this work is twofold: (i) compare and analyze the quality of the data
against high-precision numerical propagation. (ii) Leverage Physics-Informed
Machine Learning to extract relevant satellite quantities, such as
non-conservative forces, during the decay process. By analyzing two months of
real orbital data for approximately 1500 Starlink satellites, we identify
discrepancies between high precision numerical algorithms and the published
ephemerides, recognizing the use of simplified dynamics at fixed thresholds,
planned maneuvers, and limitations in uncertainty propagations. Furthermore, we
compare data obtained from multiple sources to track and analyze deorbiting
satellites over the same period. Empirically, we extract the acceleration
profile of satellites during deorbiting and provide insights relating to the
effects of non-conservative forces during reentry. For non-deorbiting
satellites, the position Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was approximately 300 m,
while for deorbiting satellites it increased to about 600 m. Through this
in-depth analysis, we highlight potential limitations in publicly available
data for accurate and robust Space Situational Awareness (SSA), and
importantly, we propose a data-driven model of satellite decay in
mega-constellations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09362v1"><h2>deep-REMAP: Probabilistic Parameterization of Stellar Spectra Using
  Regularized Multi-Task Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Sankalp Gilda</br>Comments: 14 pages. Accepted for publication in RASTI</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.AI</br><p>In the era of exploding survey volumes, traditional methods of spectroscopic
analysis are being pushed to their limits. In response, we develop deep-REMAP,
a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task
approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We
train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral
library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of
observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to
732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated
on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective
temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\log \rm{g}$), and metallicity
([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in
$T_{\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding
loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to
parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties.
While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other
surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway
for stellar characterization.</p></br>
