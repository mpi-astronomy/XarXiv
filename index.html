  algorithm</h2></a>Authors:  Eloy Pe√±a-Asensio, Fabio Ferrari</br>Comments: Accepted in The Astronomical Journal</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Accurate identification of meteoroid streams is central to understanding
their origins and evolution. However, overlapping clusters and background noise
hinder classification, an issue amplified for missions such as ESA's LUMIO that
rely on meteor shower observations to infer lunar meteoroid impact parameters.
This study evaluates the performance of the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for unsupervised
meteoroid stream identification, comparing its outcomes with the established
Cameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) look-up table method. We analyze
the CAMS Meteoroid Orbit Database v3.0 using three feature vectors: LUTAB (CAMS
geocentric parameters), ORBIT (heliocentric orbital elements), and GEO (adapted
geocentric parameters). HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes
and two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters
with CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal
mapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score,
Normalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis
further supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39
meteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies
30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose
identification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior
performance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful
selection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally
consistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical
coherence. These results underscore HDBSCAN's potential as a mathematically
consistent alternative for meteoroid stream identification, although further
validation is needed to assess physical validity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.01939v1"><h2>SpecCLIP: Aligning and Translating Spectroscopic Measurements for Stars</h2></a>Authors:  Xiaosheng Zhao, Yang Huang, Guirong Xue, Xiao Kong, Jifeng Liu, Xiaoyu Tang, Timothy C.

  Comments welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural
language understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization.
Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework
that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar
spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical
information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral
datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support
diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves
pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed
by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different
instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve
spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between
spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information
between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework
enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We
demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets
improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and
chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and
precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.
Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities
offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively
trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance
precision stellar spectroscopy.</p></br>
