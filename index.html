T. Rüdisser, G. Nguyen, J. Le Louëdec, C. Möstl</br>Comments: 25 pages, 9 figures, 1 table, submitted to AGU Space Weather on 14th

weather disturbances, posing risks to both technological infrastructure and
human activities. Automatic detection of ICMEs in solar wind in situ data is
essential for early warning systems. While several methods have been proposed
to identify these structures in time series data, robust real-time detection
remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present ARCANE - the first
framework explicitly designed for early ICME detection in streaming solar wind
data under realistic operational constraints, enabling event identification
without requiring observation of the full structure. Our approach evaluates the
strengths and limitations of detection models by comparing a machine
learning-based method to a threshold-based baseline. The ResUNet++ model,
previously validated on science data, significantly outperforms the baseline,
particularly in detecting high-impact events, while retaining solid performance
on lower-impact cases. Notably, we find that using real-time solar wind (RTSW)
data instead of high-resolution science data leads to only minimal performance
degradation. Despite the challenges of operational settings, our detection
pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.53, with an average detection delay of 21.5%
of the event's duration while only seeing a minimal amount of data. As more
data becomes available, the performance increases significantly. These results
mark a substantial step forward in automated space weather monitoring and lay
the groundwork for enhanced real-time forecasting capabilities.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08940v1"><h2>NeurIPS 2024 Ariel Data Challenge: Characterisation of Exoplanetary
  Atmospheres Using a Data-Centric Approach</h2></a>Authors:  Jeremie Blanchard, Lisa Casino, Jordan Gierschendorf</br>Comments: 12 pages</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM</br><p>The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres through spectral analysis is
a complex challenge. The NeurIPS 2024 Ariel Data Challenge, in collaboration
with the European Space Agency's (ESA) Ariel mission, provided an opportunity
to explore machine learning techniques for extracting atmospheric compositions
from simulated spectral data. In this work, we focus on a data-centric business
approach, prioritizing generalization over competition-specific optimization.
We briefly outline multiple experimental axes, including feature extraction,
signal transformation, and heteroskedastic uncertainty modeling. Our
experiments demonstrate that uncertainty estimation plays a crucial role in the
Gaussian Log-Likelihood (GLL) score, impacting performance by several
percentage points. Despite improving the GLL score by 11%, our results
highlight the inherent limitations of tabular modeling and feature engineering
for this task, as well as the constraints of a business-driven approach within
a Kaggle-style competition framework. Our findings emphasize the trade-offs
between model simplicity, interpretability, and generalization in astrophysical
data analysis.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08410v1"><h2>Understanding molecular ratios in the carbon and oxygen poor outer Milky
  Way with interpretable machine learning</h2></a>Authors:  Gijs Vermariën, Serena Viti, Johannes Heyl, Francesco Fontani</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in A&A Sect. 6. Interstellar and
  circumstellar matter</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Context. The outer Milky Way has a lower metallicity than our solar
neighbourhood, but still many molecules are detected in the region. Molecular
line ratios can serve as probes to better understand the chemistry and physics
in these regions. Aims. We use interpretable machine learning to study 9
different molecular ratios, helping us understand the forward connection
between the physics of these environments and the carbon and oxygen
chemistries. Methods. Using a large grid of astrochemical models generated
using UCLCHEM, we study the properties of molecular clouds of low oxygen and
carbon initial abundance. We first try to understand the line ratios using a
classical analysis. We then move on to using interpretable machine learning,
namely Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to understand the higher order
dependencies of the ratios over the entire parameter grid. Lastly we use the
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection technique (UMAP) as a reduction
method to create intuitive groupings of models. Results. We find that the
parameter space is well covered by the line ratios, allowing us to investigate
all input parameters. SHAP analysis shows that the temperature and density are
the most important features, but the carbon and oxygen abundances are important
in parts of the parameter space. Lastly, we find that we can group different
types of ratios using UMAP. Conclusions. We show the chosen ratios are mostly
sensitive to changes in the carbon initial abundance, together with the
temperature and density. Especially the CN/HCN and HNC/HCN ratio are shown to
be sensitive to the initial carbon abundance, making them excellent probes for
this parameter. Out of the ratios, only CS/SO shows a sensitivity to the oxygen
abundance.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10283v1"><h2>Comparative Analysis of Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution and Data Unfolding
  with Mean Integrated Square Error Optimization</h2></a>Authors:  Nikolay D. Gagunashvili</br>Comments: 15 pages, 18 figures</br>Primary Category: physics.data-an</br>All Categories: physics.data-an, astro-ph.IM, hep-ex, nucl-ex, stat.AP, 62-07 (Primary), 62F03, 62F10, 62P35, 62P30 (Secondary)</br><p>Two maximum likelihood-based algorithms for unfolding or deconvolution are
considered: the Richardson-Lucy method and the Data Unfolding method with Mean
Integrated Square Error (MISE) optimization [10]. Unfolding is viewed as a
procedure for estimating an unknown probability density function. Both external
and internal quality assessment methods can be applied for this purpose. In
some cases, external criteria exist to evaluate deconvolution quality. A
typical example is the deconvolution of a blurred image, where the sharpness of
the restored image serves as an indicator of quality. However, defining such
external criteria can be challenging, particularly when a measurement has not
been performed previously. In such instances, internal criteria are necessary
to assess the quality of the result independently of external information. The
article discusses two internal criteria: MISE for the unfolded distribution and
the condition number of the correlation matrix of the unfolded distribution.
These internal quality criteria are applied to a comparative analysis of the
two methods using identical numerical data. The results of the analysis
demonstrate the superiority of the Data Unfolding method with MISE optimization
over the Richardson-Lucy method.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10299v1"><h2>Nature-inspired optimization, the Philippine Eagle, and cosmological
  parameter estimation</h2></a>Authors:  Reginald Christian Bernardo, Erika Antonette Enriquez, Renier Mendoza, Reinabelle Reyes, Arrianne Crystal Velasco</br>Comments: 24 pages + refs, 13 figures, comments welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an</br><p>Precise and accurate estimation of cosmological parameters is crucial for
understanding the Universe's dynamics and addressing cosmological tensions. In
this methods paper, we explore bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, including
the Improved Multi-Operator Differential Evolution scheme and the Philippine
Eagle Optimization Algorithm (PEOA), alongside the relatively known genetic
algorithm, for cosmological parameter estimation. Using mock data that underlay
a true fiducial cosmology, we test the viability of each optimization method to
recover the input cosmological parameters with confidence regions generated by
bootstrapping on top of optimization. We compare the results with Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) in terms of accuracy and precision, and show that PEOA
performs comparably well under the specific circumstances provided.
Understandably, Bayesian inference and optimization serve distinct purposes,
but comparing them highlights the potential of nature-inspired algorithms in
cosmological analysis, offering alternative pathways to explore parameter
spaces and validate standard results.</p></br>
