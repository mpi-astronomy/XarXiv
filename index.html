scattering covariances, the most recent iteration of the scattering transforms
statistics. This model is designed to augment by several orders of magnitude
the number of map simulations in datasets of computationally expensive CMB
instrumental systematics simulations, including their non-Gaussian and
inhomogeneous features. Unlike conventional neural network-based algorithms,
this generative model requires only a minimal number of training samples,
making it highly compatible with the computational constraints of typical CMB
simulation campaigns. We validate the method using realistic simulations of CMB
systematics, which are particularly challenging to emulate, and perform
extensive statistical tests to confirm its ability to produce new statistically
independent approximate realizations. Remarkably, even when trained on as few
as 10 simulations, the emulator closely reproduces key summary statistics --
including the angular power spectrum, scattering coefficients, and Minkowski
functionals -- and provides pixel-to-pixel covariance estimates with
substantially reduced sample noise compared to those obtained without
augmentation. The proposed approach has the potential to shift the paradigm in
simulation campaign design. Instead of producing large numbers of low- or
medium-accuracy simulations, future pipelines can focus on generating a few
high-accuracy simulations that are then efficiently augmented using such
generative model. This promises significant benefits for current and
forthcoming cosmological surveys such as $Planck$, $LiteBIRD$, Simons
Observatory, CMB-S4, Euclid and Rubin-LSST. We make both the general framework
for scattering transform statistics available at

  non-stationary noise artifacts</h2></a>Authors:  Niklas Houba</br>Comments: 19 pages, 10 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, gr-qc, physics.data-an, physics.ins-det</br><p>The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe gravitational
waves in the millihertz frequency band, detecting signals from a vast number of
astrophysical sources embedded in instrumental noise. Extracting individual
signals from these overlapping contributions is a fundamental challenge in LISA
data analysis and is traditionally addressed using computationally expensive
stochastic Bayesian techniques. In this work, we present a deep learning-based
framework for blind source separation in LISA data, employing an
encoder-decoder architecture commonly used in digital audio processing to
isolate individual signals within complex mixtures. Our approach enables
signals from massive black-hole binaries, Galactic binaries, and instrumental
glitches to be disentangled directly in a single step, circumventing the need
for sequential source identification and subtraction. By learning clustered
latent space representations, the framework provides a scalable alternative to
conventional methods, with applications in both low-latency event detection and
full-scale global-fit analyses. As a proof of concept, we assess the model's
performance using simulated LISA data in a controlled setting with a limited
number of overlapping sources. The results highlight deep source separation as
a promising tool for LISA, paving the way for future extensions to more complex
datasets.</p></br>
