  Graph Neural Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Nikhil Garuda, John F. Wu, Dylan Nelson, Annalisa Pillepich</br>Comments: 9 pages, 4 figures, accepted at the NeurIPS ML4PS 2024 workshop</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Galaxies grow and evolve in dark matter halos. Because dark matter is not
visible, galaxies' halo masses ($\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$) must be inferred
indirectly. We present a graph neural network (GNN) model for predicting
$\rm{M}_{\rm{halo}}$ from stellar mass ($\rm{M}_{*}$) in simulated galaxy
clusters using data from the IllustrisTNG simulation suite. Unlike traditional
machine learning models like random forests, our GNN captures the
information-rich substructure of galaxy clusters by using spatial and kinematic
relationships between galaxy neighbour. A GNN model trained on the TNG-Cluster
dataset and independently tested on the TNG300 simulation achieves superior
predictive performance compared to other baseline models we tested. Future work
will extend this approach to different simulations and real observational
datasets to further validate the GNN model's ability to generalise.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10409v1"><h2>Design of Dedicated Tilt-to-Length Calibration Maneuvers for LISA</h2></a>Authors:  Henry Wegener, Sarah Paczkowski, Marie-Sophie Hartig, Martin Hewitson, Gerhard Heinzel, Gudrun Wanner</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an, physics.ins-det</br><p>Tilts of certain elements within a laser interferometer can undesirably
couple into measurements as a form of noise, known as tilt-to-length (TTL)
coupling. This TTL coupling is anticipated to be one of the primary noise
sources in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, after Time
Delay Interferometry (TDI) is applied. Despite the careful interferometer
design and calibration on the ground, TTL is likely to require in-flight
mitigation through post-processing subtraction to achieve the necessary
sensitivity. Past research has demonstrated TTL subtraction in simulations
through the estimation of 24 linear coupling coefficients using a noise
minimization approach. This paper investigates an approach based on performing
rotation maneuvers for estimating coupling coefficients with low uncertainties.
In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and optimal configurations of such
maneuvers to identify the most efficient solutions. We assess the efficacy of
TTL calibration maneuvers by modulating either the spacecraft attitude or the
Moving Optical Sub-Assembly (MOSA) yaw angle. We found that sinusoidal signals
with amplitudes of around 30 nrad and frequencies near 43 mHz are practical and
nearly optimal choices for such modulations. Employing different frequencies
generates uncorrelated signals, allowing for multiple maneuvers to be executed
simultaneously. Our simulations enable us to estimate the TTL coefficients with
precision below 15 um/rad (1-sigma, in free space) after a total maneuver time
of 20 minutes. The results are compared to the estimation uncertainties that
can be achieved without using maneuvers.</p></br>
