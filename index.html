  Analyses</h2></a>Authors:  Mick Wright, Justin Janquart, Paolo Cremonese, Juno C. L. Chan, Alvin K. Y. Li, Otto A. Hannuksela, Rico K. L. Lo, Jose M. Ezquiaga, Daniel Williams, Michael Williams, Gregory Ashton, Rhiannon Udall, Anupreeta More, Laura Uronen, Ankur Barsode, Eungwang Seo, David Keitel, Srasthi Goyal, Jef Heynen, Anna Liu</br>Comments: 8 Pages, 1 Figure, 2 Tables</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>In this work, we present LensingFlow. This is an implementation of an
automated workflow to search for evidence of gravitational lensing in a large
series of gravitational wave events. This workflow conducts searches for
evidence in all generally considered lensing regimes. The implementation of
this workflow is built atop the Asimov automation framework and CBCFlow
metadata management software and the resulting product therefore encompasses
both the automated running and status checking of jobs in the workflow as well
as the automated production and storage of relevant metadata from these jobs to
allow for later reproduction. This workflow encompasses a number of existing
lensing pipelines and has been designed to accommodate any additional future
pipelines to provide both a current and future basis on which to conduct large
scale lensing analyses of gravitational wave signal catalogues. The workflow
also implements a prioritisation management system for jobs submitted to the
schedulers in common usage in computing clusters ensuring both the completion
of the workflow across the entire catalogue of events as well as the priority
completion of the most significant candidates. As a first proof-of-concept
demonstration, we deploy LensingFlow on a mock data challenge comprising 10
signals in which signatures of each lensing regime are represented. LensingFlow
successfully ran and identified the candidates from this data through its
automated checks of results from consituent analyses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20378v1"><h2>Set-based Implicit Likelihood Inference of Galaxy Cluster Mass</h2></a>Authors:  Bonny Y. Wang, Leander Thiele</br>Comments: 5 pages, 4 figures; accepted as a spotlight talk at ICML-colocated
  ML4Astro 2025 workshop</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.CO</br><p>We present a set-based machine learning framework that infers posterior
distributions of galaxy cluster masses from projected galaxy dynamics. Our
model combines Deep Sets and conditional normalizing flows to incorporate both
positional and velocity information of member galaxies to predict residual
corrections to the $M$-$\sigma$ relation for improved interpretability. Trained
on the Uchuu-UniverseMachine simulation, our approach significantly reduces
scatter and provides well-calibrated uncertainties across the full mass range
compared to traditional dynamical estimates.</p></br>
