We propose a novel F10.7 index forecasting method using wavelet decomposition, which feeds F10.7 together with its decomposed approximate and detail signals into the iTransformer model. We also incorporate the International Sunspot Number (ISN) and its wavelet-decomposed signals to assess their influence on prediction performance. Our optimal method is then compared with the latest method from S. Yan et al. (2025) and three operational models (SWPC, BGS, CLS). Additionally, we transfer our method to the PatchTST model used in H. Ye et al. (2024) and compare our method with theirs on Dataset B. Key findings include: (1) The wavelet-based combination methods overall outperform the baseline using only F10.7 index. The prediction performance improves as higher-level approximate and detail signals are incrementally added. The Combination 6 method integrating F10.7 with its first to fifth level approximate and detail signals outperforms methods using only approximate or detail signals. (2) Incorporating ISN and its wavelet-decomposed signals does not enhance prediction performance. (3) The Combination 6 method significantly surpasses S. Yan et al. (2025) and three operational models, with RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 18.22%, 15.09%, and 8.57%, respectively, against the former method. It also excels across four different conditions of solar activity. (4) Our method demonstrates superior generalization and prediction capability over the method of H. Ye et al. (2024) across all forecast horizons. To our knowledge, this is the first application of wavelet decomposition in F10.7 prediction, substantially improving forecast performance.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.19984v1"><h2>Multivariate time-series forecasting of ASTRI-Horn monitoring data: A Normal Behavior Model</h2></a>Authors:  Federico Incardona, Alessandro Costa, Farida Farsian, Francesco Franchina, Giuseppe Leto, Emilio Mastriani, Kevin Munari, Giovanni Pareschi, Salvatore Scuderi, Sebastiano Spinello, Gino Tosti</br>Comments: 15 pages, 12 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, cs.LG</br><p>This study presents a Normal Behavior Model (NBM) developed to forecast monitoring time-series data from the ASTRI-Horn Cherenkov telescope under normal operating conditions. The analysis focused on 15 physical variables acquired by the Telescope Control Unit between September 2022 and July 2024, representing sensor measurements from the Azimuth and Elevation motors. After data cleaning, resampling, feature selection, and correlation analysis, the dataset was segmented into fixed-length intervals, in which the first I samples represented the input sequence provided to the model, while the forecast length, T, indicated the number of future time steps to be predicted. A sliding-window technique was then applied to increase the number of intervals. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was trained to perform multivariate forecasting across all features simultaneously. Model performance was evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the Normalized Median Absolute Deviation (NMAD), and it was also benchmarked against a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The MLP model demonstrated consistent results across different features and I-T configurations, and matched the performance of the LSTM while converging faster. It achieved an MSE of 0.019+/-0.003 and an NMAD of 0.032+/-0.009 on the test set under its best configuration (4 hidden layers, 720 units per layer, and I-T lengths of 300 samples each, corresponding to 5 hours at 1-minute resolution). Extending the forecast horizon up to 6.5 hours-the maximum allowed by this configuration-did not degrade performance, confirming the model's effectiveness in providing reliable hour-scale predictions. The proposed NBM provides a powerful tool for enabling early anomaly detection in online ASTRI-Horn monitoring time series, offering a basis for the future development of a prognostics and health management system that supports predictive maintenance.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.19301v1"><h2>Parameter Estimation Limits in Blazars</h2></a>Authors:  Agniva Roychowdhury</br>Comments: 11 pages, 7 figures; submitted to ApJL, comments welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.HE</br>All Categories: astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an</br><p>Parameter degeneracy in blazar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is known but rarely quantified. This paper introduces a Fisher Information approach to determine theoretical limits to information extraction in the context of one-zone models. By evaluating the total Fisher Information by varying $δ$, $B$, $p$, $γ_{\rm min}$ and $γ_{\rm max}$, we find that EC models encode Fisher information $\gtrsim10^4$ times less than that in SSC models, establishing differences in limits of physical information extraction even in the case of perfect sampling. Moreover, the Fisher information in both SSC and EC models exhibit strong fluctuations across the parameter space, but since the magnitudes are orders of magnitude lower in EC, limits of parameter inference are expected to be worse in FSRQ SEDs than BL Lacs. We also find that the Doppler factor $δ$ carries at least $10^{2-3}$ more Fisher information than that for $p$ and $B$ in both EC and SSC, making $δ$ the most constrained SED parameter. Applying our Fisher Information motivated framework to real flaring SEDs of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) CTA 102 and 3C 279, we show that mild variations in $δ$ and $p$ can appreciably produce the flaring SEDs starting from the quiescent model, while two other flares in 3C 279 simple geometric and spectral considerations cannot reproduce the flares, reducing the efficacy of one-zone models. We propose that time-resolved SED models are indispensable to constraining physical parameters in EC-dominated blazars.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23321v1"><h2>Deep ensemble graph neural networks for probabilistic cosmic-ray direction and energy reconstruction in autonomous radio arrays</h2></a>Authors:  Arsène Ferrière, Aurélien Benoit-Lévy, Olivier Martineau-Huynh, Matías Tueros</br>Comments: Submitted to Astroparticle Physics Journal</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Using advanced machine learning techniques, we developed a method for reconstructing precisely the arrival direction and energy of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from the voltage traces they induced on ground-based radio detector arrays.
  In our approach, triggered antennas are represented as a graph structure, which serves as input for a graph neural network (GNN). By incorporating physical knowledge into both the GNN architecture and the input data, we improve the precision and reduce the required size of the training set with respect to a fully data-driven approach. This method achieves an angular resolution of 0.092° and an electromagnetic energy reconstruction resolution of 16.4% on simulated data with realistic noise conditions.
  We also employ uncertainty estimation methods to enhance the reliability of our predictions, quantifying the confidence of the GNN's outputs and providing confidence intervals for both direction and energy reconstruction. Finally, we investigate strategies to verify the model's consistency and robustness under real life variations, with the goal of identifying scenarios in which predictions remain reliable despite domain shifts between simulation and reality.</p></br>
