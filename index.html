  Space Telescope Operations</h2></a>Authors:  Pablo GÃ³mez, Roland D. Vavrek, Guillermo Buenadicha, John Hoar, Sandor Kruk, Jan Reerink</br>Comments: Presented at IAC 2024</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM</br><p>State-of-the-art space science missions increasingly rely on automation due
to spacecraft complexity and the costs of human oversight. The high volume of
data, including scientific and telemetry data, makes manual inspection
challenging. Machine learning offers significant potential to meet these
demands.
  The Euclid space telescope, in its survey phase since February 2024,
exemplifies this shift. Euclid's success depends on accurate monitoring and
interpretation of housekeeping telemetry and science-derived data. Thousands of
telemetry parameters, monitored as time series, may or may not impact the
quality of scientific data. These parameters have complex interdependencies,
often due to physical relationships (e.g., proximity of temperature sensors).
Optimising science operations requires careful anomaly detection and
identification of hidden parameter states. Moreover, understanding the
interactions between known anomalies and physical quantities is crucial yet
complex, as related parameters may display anomalies with varied timing and
intensity.
  We address these challenges by analysing temperature anomalies in Euclid's
telemetry from February to August 2024, focusing on eleven temperature
parameters and 35 covariates. We use a predictive XGBoost model to forecast
temperatures based on historical values, detecting anomalies as deviations from
predictions. A second XGBoost model predicts anomalies from covariates,
capturing their relationships to temperature anomalies. We identify the top
three anomalies per parameter and analyse their interactions with covariates
using SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), enabling rapid, automated analysis
of complex parameter relationships.
  Our method demonstrates how machine learning can enhance telemetry
monitoring, offering scalable solutions for other missions with similar data
challenges.</p></br>
