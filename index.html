H_r < 8.2$ detected in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we characterize the
relationships between their dynamical state and physical properties -- namely
$H_r$, indicating size; colors, indicating surface composition; and flux
variation semi-amplitude $A$, indicating asphericity and surface inhomogeneity.
We seek ``birth'' physical distributions that can recreate these parameters in
every dynamical class. We show that the observed colors of these TNOs are
consistent with 2 Gaussian distributions in $griz$ space, ``near-IR bright''
(NIRB) and ``near-IR faint'' (NIRF), presumably an inner and outer birth
population, respectively. We find a model in which both the NIRB and NIRF $H_r$
and $A$ distributions are independent of current dynamical states, supporting
their assignment as birth populations. All objects are consistent with a common
rolling $p(H_r)$, but NIRF objects are significantly more variable. Cold
classicals (CCs) are purely NIRF, while hot classical (HC), scattered, and
detached TNOs are consistent with $\approx70\%$ NIRB, and resonances' NIRB
fractions show significant variation. The NIRB component of the HCs and of some
resonances have broader inclination distributions than the NIRFs, i.e. their
current dynamics retains information about birth location. We find evidence for
radial stratification within the birth NIRB population, in that HC NIRBs are on
average redder than detached or scattered NIRBs; a similar effect distinguishes
CCs from other NIRFs. We estimate total object counts and masses of each class
within our $H_r$ range. These results will strongly constrain models of the
outer solar system.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01484v1"><h2>Sequencing Silicates in the IRS Debris Disk Catalog I: Methodology for
  Unsupervised Clustering</h2></a>Authors:  Cicero X. Lu, Tushar Mittal, Christine H. Chen, Alexis Y. Li, Kadin Worthen, B. A. Sargent, Carey M. Lisse, G. C. Sloan, Dean C. Hines, Dan M. Watson, Isabel Rebollido, Bin B. Ren, Joel D. Green</br>Comments: 23 pages, 16 figures, Accepted to ApJS, $\texttt{CLUES}$ software
  available on GitHub</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Debris disks, which consist of dust, planetesimals, planets, and gas, offer a
unique window into the mineralogical composition of their parent bodies,
especially during the critical phase of terrestrial planet formation spanning
10 to a few hundred million years. Observations from the $\textit{Spitzer}$
Space Telescope have unveiled thousands of debris disks, yet systematic studies
remain scarce, let alone those with unsupervised clustering techniques. This
study introduces $\texttt{CLUES}$ (CLustering UnsupErvised with Sequencer), a
novel, non-parametric, fully-interpretable machine-learning spectral analysis
tool designed to analyze and classify the spectral data of debris disks.
$\texttt{CLUES}$ combines multiple unsupervised clustering methods with
multi-scale distance measures to discern new groupings and trends, offering
insights into compositional diversity and geophysical processes within these
disks. Our analysis allows us to explore a vast parameter space in debris disk
mineralogy and also offers broader applications in fields such as
protoplanetary disks and solar system objects. This paper details the
methodology, implementation, and initial results of $\texttt{CLUES}$, setting
the stage for more detailed follow-up studies focusing on debris disk
mineralogy and demographics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01496v1"><h2>ORACLE: A Real-Time, Hierarchical, Deep-Learning Photometric Classifier
  for the LSST</h2></a>Authors:  Ved G. Shah, Alex Gagliano, Konstantin Malanchev, Gautham Narayan, The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration</br>Comments: 29 pages, 19 figures, 9 tables. Submitted to ApJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>We present ORACLE, the first hierarchical deep-learning model for real-time,
context-aware classification of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena.
ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has
been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide
high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with
as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each
object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and
brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a
final prediction. Training on $\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST
Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level
(Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of
photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual
information, for each event; this increases to $>$0.99 once 64 days of the
light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for
19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei,
variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE
with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for
the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level
classifications much earlier. The code and model weights used in this work are
publicly available at our associated GitHub repository

Alobaid, Jason T. L. Wang, Haimin Wang, Ju Jing, Yasser Abduallah, Zhenduo Wang, Hameedullah Farooki, Huseyin Cavus, Vasyl Yurchyshyn</br>Comments: 21 pages, 13 figures</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.SR, physics.space-ph</br><p>The application of machine learning to the study of coronal mass ejections
(CMEs) and their impacts on Earth has seen significant growth recently.
Understanding and forecasting CME geoeffectiveness is crucial for protecting
infrastructure in space and ensuring the resilience of technological systems on
Earth. Here we present GeoCME, a deep-learning framework designed to predict,
deterministically or probabilistically, whether a CME event that arrives at
Earth will cause a geomagnetic storm. A geomagnetic storm is defined as a
disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere during which the minimum Dst index
value is less than -50 nT. GeoCME is trained on observations from the
instruments including LASCO C2, EIT and MDI on board the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO), focusing on a dataset that includes 136 halo/partial halo
CMEs in Solar Cycle 23. Using ensemble and transfer learning techniques, GeoCME
is capable of extracting features hidden in the SOHO observations and making
predictions based on the learned features. Our experimental results demonstrate
the good performance of GeoCME, achieving a Matthew's correlation coefficient
of 0.807 and a true skill statistics score of 0.714 when the tool is used as a
deterministic prediction model. When the tool is used as a probabilistic
forecasting model, it achieves a Brier score of 0.094 and a Brier skill score
of 0.493. These results are promising, showing that the proposed GeoCME can
help enhance our understanding of CME-triggered solar-terrestrial interactions.</p></br>
