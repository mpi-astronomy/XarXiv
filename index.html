  and Clustering Tensions</h2></a>Authors:  Rahul Shah, Purba Mukherjee, Soumadeep Saha, Utpal Garain, Supratik Pal</br>Comments: 5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables. Comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Conventional calibration of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data relies on
estimation of the sound horizon at drag epoch $r_d$ from early universe
observations by assuming a cosmological model. We present a recalibration of
two independent BAO datasets, SDSS and DESI, by employing deep learning
techniques for model-independent estimation of $r_d$, and explore the impacts
on $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters. Significant reductions in both Hubble
($H_0$) and clustering ($S_8$) tensions are observed for both the recalibrated
datasets. Moderate shifts in some other parameters hint towards further
exploration of such data-driven approaches.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15100v1"><h2>Tests for model misspecification in simulation-based inference: from
  local distortions to global model checks</h2></a>Authors:  Noemi Anau Montel, James Alvey, Christoph Weniger</br>Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures. Code available on github (NoemiAM/mist) at

validation, and model comparison are a key component of scientific model
development. Over the last few years, there has been a rapid rise in the use of
simulation-based inference (SBI) techniques for Bayesian parameter estimation,
applied to increasingly complex forward models. To move towards fully
simulation-based analysis pipelines, however, there is an urgent need for a
comprehensive simulation-based framework for model misspecification analysis.
In this work, we provide a solid and flexible foundation for a wide range of
model discrepancy analysis tasks, using distortion-driven model
misspecification tests. From a theoretical perspective, we introduce the
statistical framework built around performing many hypothesis tests for
distortions of the simulation model. We also make explicit analytic connections
to classical techniques: anomaly detection, model validation, and
goodness-of-fit residual analysis. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient
self-calibrating training algorithm that is useful for practitioners. We
demonstrate the performance of the framework in multiple scenarios, making the
connection to classical results where they are valid. Finally, we show how to
conduct such a distortion-driven model misspecification test for real
gravitational wave data, specifically on the event GW150914.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14775v1"><h2>Energy and polarization based on-line interference mitigation in radio
  interferometry</h2></a>Authors:  Sarod Yatawatta, Albert-Jan Boonstra, Chris P. Broekema</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Radio frequency interference (RFI) is a persistent contaminant in terrestrial
radio astronomy. While new radio interferometers are becoming operational,
novel sources of RFI are also emerging. In order to strengthen the mitigation
of RFI in modern radio interferometers, we propose an on-line RFI mitigation
scheme that can be run in the correlator of such interferometers. We combine
statistics based on the energy as well as the polarization alignment of the
correlated signal to develop an on-line RFI mitigation scheme that can be
applied to a data stream produced by the correlator in real-time, especially
targeted at low duty-cycle or transient RFI detection. In order to improve the
computational efficiency, we explore the use of both single precision and half
precision floating point operations in implementing the RFI mitigation
algorithm. This ideally suits its deployment in accelerator computing devices
such as graphics processing units (GPUs) as used by the LOFAR correlator. We
provide results based on real data to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15405v1"><h2>Cosmology with Persistent Homology: Parameter Inference via Machine
  Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Juan Calles, Jacky H. T. Yip, Gabriella Contardo, Jorge Nore√±a, Adam Rouhiainen, Gary Shiu</br>Comments: 28 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><p>Building upon [2308.02636], this article investigates the potential
constraining power of persistent homology for cosmological parameters and
primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes in a likelihood-free inference pipeline.
We evaluate the ability of persistence images (PIs) to infer parameters,
compared to the combined Power Spectrum and Bispectrum (PS/BS), and we compare
two types of models: neural-based, and tree-based. PIs consistently lead to
better predictions compared to the combined PS/BS when the parameters can be
constrained (i.e., for $\{\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, n_{\rm s}, f_{\rm NL}^{\rm
loc}\}$). PIs perform particularly well for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, showing the
promise of persistent homology in constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. Our
results show that combining PIs with PS/BS provides only marginal gains,
indicating that the PS/BS contains little extra or complementary information to
the PIs. Finally, we provide a visualization of the most important topological
features for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and for $\Omega_{\rm m}$. This reveals that
clusters and voids (0-cycles and 2-cycles) are most informative for
$\Omega_{\rm m}$, while $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ uses the filaments (1-cycles) in
addition to the other two types of topological features.</p></br>
