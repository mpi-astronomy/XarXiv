  inference</h2></a>Authors:  Sophie Hourihane, Katerina Chatziioannou</br>Comments: 14 pages, 7 figures</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detectors, known as "glitches," can
bias the inferred parameters of transient signals when they occur nearby in
time and frequency. These biases are addressed with a variety of methods that
remove or otherwise mitigate the impact of the glitch. Given the computational
cost and human effort required for glitch mitigation, we study the conditions
under which it is strictly necessary. We consider simulated glitches and
gravitational-wave signals in various configurations that probe their proximity
both in time and in frequency. We determine that glitches located outside the
time-frequency space spanned by the gravitational-wave model prior and with a
signal-to-noise ratio, conservatively, below 50 do not impact estimation of the
signal parameters.</p></br>
