  Rotation</h2></a>Authors:  Fatemeh Fazel Hesar, Bernard Foing, Ana M. Heras, Mojtaba Raouf, Victoria Foing, Shima Javanmardi, Fons J. Verbeek</br>Comments: 15 pages, 8 figures.

periods from corrected light curve data obtained by the NASA Kepler mission.
Traditional methods often struggle to estimate rotation periods accurately due
to noise and variability in the light curve data. The workflow involved using
initial period estimates from the LS-Periodogram and Transit Least Squares
techniques, followed by splitting the data into training, validation, and
testing sets. We employed several machine learning algorithms, including
Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting, and
also utilized a Voting Ensemble approach to improve prediction accuracy and
robustness.
  The analysis included data from multiple Kepler IDs, providing detailed
metrics on orbital periods and planet radii. Performance evaluation showed that
the Voting Ensemble model yielded the most accurate results, with an RMSE
approximately 50\% lower than the Decision Tree model and 17\% better than the
K-Nearest Neighbors model. The Random Forest model performed comparably to the
Voting Ensemble, indicating high accuracy. In contrast, the Gradient Boosting
model exhibited a worse RMSE compared to the other approaches. Comparisons of
the predicted rotation periods to the photometric reference periods showed
close alignment, suggesting the machine learning models achieved high
prediction accuracy. The results indicate that machine learning, particularly
ensemble methods, can effectively solve the problem of accurately estimating
stellar rotation periods, with significant implications for advancing the study
of exoplanets and stellar astrophysics.</p></br>
