  Precise chemical abundances with neural networks</h2></a>Authors:  Giulia Martos, Jorge Meléndez, Lorenzo Spina, Sara Lucatello</br>Comments: Accepted by A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG, cs.NE</br><p>The aim of this work is to obtain precise atmospheric parameters and chemical
abundances automatically for solar twins and analogs to find signatures of
exoplanets, as well as to assess how peculiar the Sun is compared to these
stars and to analyze any possible fine structures in the Galactic thin disk. We
developed a neural network (NN) algorithm using Python to obtain these
parameters for a sample of 99 solar twins and solar analogs previously studied
in the literature from normalized high-quality spectra from HARPS, with a
resolving power of R $\sim$ 115000 and a signal-to-noise ratio S/N > 400. We
obtained precise atmospheric parameters and abundance ratios [X/Fe] of 20
chemical elements (Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni,
Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba). The results are in line with the literature, with average
differences and standard deviations of $(2 \pm 27)$ K for T$_{\rm eff}$, $(0.00
\pm 0.06)$ dex for log g, $(0.00 \pm 0.02)$ dex for [Fe/H], $(-0.01 \pm 0.05)$
km s$^{-1}$ for microturbulence velocity, $(0.02 \pm 0.08)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the
macro turbulence velocity, and $(-0.12 \pm 0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the projected
rotational velocity (vsin$i$). Regarding the chemical abundances, most of the
elements agree with the literature within 0.01 - 0.02 dex. The abundances were
corrected from the effects of the Galactic chemical evolution and analyzed with
the condensation temperature (T$_{\rm cond}$) to verify whether the stars
presented depletion of refractories compared to volatiles. We found that the
Sun is more depleted in refractory elements compared to volatiles than 89% of
the studied solar analogs, with a significance of 9.5$\sigma$ when compared to
the stars without detected exoplanets. We also found the possible presence of
three subpopulations in the solar analogs: one Cu-rich, one Cu-poor, and the
last one slightly older and poor in Na.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17665v1"><h2>Advanced Modeling for Exoplanet Detection and Characterization</h2></a>Authors:  Krishna Chamarthy</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Research into light curves from stars (temporal variation of brightness) has
completely changed how exoplanets are discovered or characterised. This study
including star light curves from the Kepler dataset as a way to discover
exoplanets (planetary transits) and derive some estimate of their physical
characteristics by the light curve and machine learning methods. The dataset
consists of measured flux (recordings) for many individual stars and we will
examine the light curve of each star and look for periodic dips in brightness
due to an astronomical body making a transit. We will apply variables derived
from an established method for deriving measurements from light curve data to
derive key parameters related to the planet we observed during the transit,
such as distance to the host star, orbital period, radius. The orbital period
will typically be measured based on the time between transit of the subsequent
timelines and the radius will be measured based on the depth of transit. The
density of the star and planet can also be estimated from the transit event, as
well as very limited information on the albedo (reflectivity) and atmosphere of
the planet based on transmission spectroscopy and/or the analysis of phase
curve for levels of flux. In addition to these methods, we will employ some
machine learning classification of the stars (i.e. likely have an exoplanet or
likely do not have an exoplanet) based on flux change. This could help fulfil
both the process of looking for exoplanets more efficient as well as providing
important parameters for the planet. This will provide a much quicker means of
searching the vast astronomical datasets for the likelihood of exoplanets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19679v1"><h2>Extreme Learning Machines for Exoplanet Simulations: A Faster,
  Lightweight Alternative to Deep Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Tara P. A. Tahseen, Luís F. Simões, Kai Hou Yip, Nikolaos Nikolaou, João M. Mendonça, Ingo P. Waldmann</br>Comments: 20 pages, 16 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.ao-ph</br><p>Increasing resolution and coverage of astrophysical and climate data
necessitates increasingly sophisticated models, often pushing the limits of
computational feasibility. While emulation methods can reduce calculation
costs, the neural architectures typically used--optimised via gradient
descent--are themselves computationally expensive to train, particularly in
terms of data generation requirements. This paper investigates the utility of
the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a lightweight, non-gradient-based machine
learning algorithm for accelerating complex physical models.
  We evaluate ELM surrogate models in two test cases with different data
structures: (i) sequentially-structured data, and (ii) image-structured data.
For test case (i), where the number of samples $N$ >> the dimensionality of
input data $d$, ELMs achieve remarkable efficiency, offering a 100,000$\times$
faster training time and a 40$\times$ faster prediction speed compared to a
Bi-Directional Recurrent Neural Network (BIRNN), whilst improving upon BIRNN
test performance. For test case (ii), characterised by $d >> N$ and image-based
inputs, a single ELM was insufficient, but an ensemble of 50 individual ELM
predictors achieves comparable accuracy to a benchmark Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), with a 16.4$\times$ reduction in training time, though costing a
6.9$\times$ increase in prediction time. We find different sample efficiency
characteristics between the test cases: in test case (i) individual ELMs
demonstrate superior sample efficiency, requiring only 0.28% of the training
dataset compared to the benchmark BIRNN, while in test case (ii) the ensemble
approach requires 78% of the data used by the CNN to achieve comparable
results--representing a trade-off between sample efficiency and model
complexity.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.19925v1"><h2>Direct reconstruction of the Reionization history from 21cm 2D Power
  Spectra</h2></a>Authors:  Yannic Pietschke, Caroline Heneka, Tom Schlenker, Ayodele Ore, Benedikt Schosser</br>Comments: 19 pages, 10 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an</br><p>The 21cm line from the spin-flip transition of neutral hydrogen (HI) provides
a unique window into the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), the final phase
transition of our Universe. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) enables precise
measurements of 21cm fluctuations that trace ionization, temperature, and
density fluctuations of the intergalactic medium (IGM). Nevertheless, a direct
reconstruction of the timeline of the EoR in terms of the progress of
ionization remains an ongoing challenge due to the highly non-Gaussian nature
and thus intractable likelihood of the 21cm signal. Here, we present EoRFlow, a
simulation-based inference (SBI) framework for reconstructing the global
neutral hydrogen fraction $x_{\mathrm{HI}}(z)$ directly from 2D cylindrically
averaged power spectra (2DPS) of the 21cm signal. We validate our method on
realistic mock datasets for SKA-Low. Bypassing the need for explicit likelihood
formulations, our approach enables fast, unbiased posterior estimation of the
$x_{\mathrm{HI}}$ evolution in narrow redshift slices, allowing for piecewise
reconstruction of the global reionization history. By directly inferring the
reionization history from 21cm power spectra, our framework provides a scalable
and robust path forward for 21cm cosmology in the SKA era.</p></br>
