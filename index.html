  and Lens Mass with Score-Based Models</h2></a>Authors:  Gabriel Missael Barco, Ronan Legin, Connor Stone, Yashar Hezaveh, Laurence Perreault-Levasseur</br>Comments: 18 pages, 9 figures, 1 table. Accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop
  on Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><p>Score-based models can serve as expressive, data-driven priors for scientific
inverse problems. In strong gravitational lensing, they enable posterior
inference of a background galaxy from its distorted, multiply-imaged
observation. Previous work, however, assumes that the lens mass distribution
(and thus the forward operator) is known. We relax this assumption by jointly
inferring the source and a parametric lens-mass profile, using a sampler based
on GibbsDDRM but operating in continuous time. The resulting reconstructions
yield residuals consistent with the observational noise, and the marginal
posteriors of the lens parameters recover true values without systematic bias.
To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of joint
source-and-lens inference with a score-based prior.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03173v1"><h2>Optimizing Earth-Moon Transfer and Cislunar Navigation: Integrating
  Low-Energy Trajectories, AI Techniques and GNSS-R Technologies</h2></a>Authors:  Arsalan Muhammad, Wasiu Akande Ahmed, Omada Friday Ojonugwa, Paul Puspendu Biswas</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO</br><p>The rapid growth of cislunar activities, including lunar landings, the Lunar
Gateway, and in-space refueling stations, requires advances in cost-efficient
trajectory design and reliable integration of navigation and remote sensing.
Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high
propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no
coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental
awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer
strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel
efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic
missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is
highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition
and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables
adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and
decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced
Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation
capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for
mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems
support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated
satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable
framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic
presence.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04681v1"><h2>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: Simulation-based $w$CDM inference

Tucker</br>Comments: 38 pages, 14 figures, submitted</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><p>Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful
techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale
structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI)
pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic
Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for
a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model
based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one
million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level.
Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural
networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn
low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with
target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation
of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter
space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias
parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear
bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference
pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic
contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs.
Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter
constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m -
S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and
effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These
results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for
upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04770v1"><h2>Machine Learning-Driven Analysis of kSZ Maps to Predict CMB Optical
  Depth $τ$</h2></a>Authors:  Farshid Farhadi Khouzani, Abinash Kumar Shaw, Paul La Plante, Bryar Mustafa Shareef, Laxmi Gewali</br>Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures, submitted to PASP</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><p>Upcoming measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, which
results from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons scattering off moving
electrons, offer a powerful probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The kSZ
signal contains key information about the timing, duration, and spatial
structure of the EoR. A precise measurement of the CMB optical depth $\tau$, a
key parameter that characterizes the universe's integrated electron density,
would significantly constrain models of early structure formation. However, the
weak kSZ signal is difficult to extract from CMB observations due to
significant contamination from astrophysical foregrounds. We present a machine
learning approach to extract $\tau$ from simulated kSZ maps. We train advanced
machine learning models, including swin transformers, on high-resolution
seminumeric simulations of the kSZ signal. To robustly quantify prediction
uncertainties of $\tau$, we employ the Laplace Approximation (LA). This
approach provides an efficient and principled Gaussian approximation to the
posterior distribution over the model's weights, allowing for reliable error
estimation. We investigate and compare two distinct application modes: a
post-hoc LA applied to a pre-trained model, and an online LA where model
weights and hyperparameters are optimized jointly by maximizing the marginal
likelihood. This approach provides a framework for robustly constraining $\tau$
and its associated uncertainty, which can enhance the analysis of upcoming CMB
surveys like the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03636v1"><h2>Quantifying Weighted Morphological Content of Large-Scale Structures via
  Simulation-Based Inference</h2></a>Authors:  M. H. Jalali Kanafi, S. M. S. Movahed</br>Comments: 19 pages, 9 figures and 3 tables. Comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, physics.comp-ph</br><p>In this work, we perform a simulation-based forecasting analysis to compare
the constraining power of two higher-order summary statistics of the
large-scale structure (LSS), the Minkowski Functionals (MFs) and the
Conditional Moments of Derivative (CMD), with a particular focus on their
sensitivity to nonlinear and anisotropic features in redshift-space. Our
analysis relies on halo catalogs from the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ) simulations
at redshift $z=0.5$, employing a likelihood-free inference framework
implemented via neural posterior estimation. At the fiducial cosmology of the
Quijote simulations $(\Omega_{m}=0.3175,\,\sigma_{8}=0.834)$, and for the
smoothing scale $R=15\,h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that the CMD yields tighter
forecasts for $(\Omega_{m}},\,\sigma_{8})$ than the zeroth- to third-order MFs
components, improving the constraint precision by ${\sim}(44\%,\,52\%)$,
${\sim}(30\%,\,45\%)$, ${\sim}(27\%,\,17\%)$, and ${\sim}(26\%,\,17\%)$,
respectively. A joint configuration combining the MFs and CMD further enhances
the precision by approximately ${\sim}27\%$ compared to the standard MFs alone,
highlighting the complementary anisotropy-sensitive information captured by the
CMD in contrast to the scalar morphological content encapsulated by the MFs. We
further extend the forecasting analysis to a continuous range of cosmological
parameter values and multiple smoothing scales. Our results show that, although
the absolute forecast uncertainty for each component of summary statistics
depends on the underlying parameter values and the adopted smoothing scale, the
relative constraining power among the summary statistics remains nearly
constant throughout.</p></br>
