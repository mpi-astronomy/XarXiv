  Series with Minimal Labeled Data</h2></a>Authors:  Rithwik Gupta, Daniel Muthukrishna, Jeroen Audenaert</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>Astronomical time-series analysis faces a critical limitation: the scarcity
of labeled observational data. We present a pre-training approach that
leverages simulations, significantly reducing the need for labeled examples
from real observations. Our models, trained on simulated data from multiple
astronomical surveys (ZTF and LSST), learn generalizable representations that
transfer effectively to downstream tasks. Using classifier-based architectures
enhanced with contrastive and adversarial objectives, we create domain-agnostic
models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements over baseline
methods in classification, redshift estimation, and anomaly detection when
fine-tuned with minimal real data. Remarkably, our models exhibit effective
zero-shot transfer capabilities, achieving comparable performance on future
telescope (LSST) simulations when trained solely on existing telescope (ZTF)
data. Furthermore, they generalize to very different astronomical phenomena
(namely variable stars from NASA's \textit{Kepler} telescope) despite being
trained on transient events, demonstrating cross-domain capabilities. Our
approach provides a practical solution for building general models when labeled
data is scarce, but domain knowledge can be encoded in simulations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13968v1"><h2>Constraining Power of Wavelet vs. Power Spectrum Statistics for CMB
  Lensing and Weak Lensing with Learned Binning</h2></a>Authors:  Kyle Boone, Georgios Valogiannis, Marco Gatti, Cora Dvorkin</br>Comments: 21 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>We present forecasts for constraints on the matter density ($\Omega_m$) and
the amplitude of matter density fluctuations at 8h$^{-1}$Mpc ($\sigma_8$) from
CMB lensing convergence maps and galaxy weak lensing convergence maps. For CMB
lensing convergence auto statistics, we compare the angular power spectra
($C_\ell$'s) to the wavelet scattering transform (WST) coefficients. For CMB
lensing convergence $\times$ galaxy weak lensing convergence statistics, we
compare the cross angular power spectra to wavelet phase harmonics (WPH). This
work also serves as the first application of WST and WPH to these probes. For
CMB lensing convergence, we find that WST and $C_\ell$'s yield similar
constraints in forecasts for the $\textit{Simons}$ Observatory and the South
Pole Telescope. However, WST gives a tighter constraint on $\sigma_8$ by a
factor of $1.7$ for $\textit{Planck}$ data. When CMB lensing convergence is
crossed with galaxy weak lensing convergence projected from $\textit{Euclid}$
Data Release 2 (DR2), we find that WPH outperforms cross-$C_\ell$'s by factors
between $2.4$ and $3.8$ for individual parameter constraints. To compare these
different summary statistics we develop a novel learned binning approach. This
method compresses summary statistics while maintaining interpretability. We
find this leads to improved constraints compared to more naive binning schemes
for $C_\ell$'s, WST, and most significantly WPH. By learning the binning and
measuring constraints on distinct data sets, our method is robust to
overfitting by construction.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13997v1"><h2>Dynamic SBI: Round-free Sequential Simulation-Based Inference with
  Adaptive Datasets</h2></a>Authors:  Huifang Lyu, James Alvey, Noemi Anau Montel, Mauro Pieroni, Christoph Weniger</br>Comments: 15 pages, 5 figures, software available at:
  https://github.com/dynamic-sbi</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, stat.ML</br><p>Simulation-based inference (SBI) is emerging as a new statistical paradigm
for addressing complex scientific inference problems. By leveraging the
representational power of deep neural networks, SBI can extract the most
informative simulation features for the parameters of interest. Sequential SBI
methods extend this approach by iteratively steering the simulation process
towards the most relevant regions of parameter space. This is typically
implemented through an algorithmic structure, in which simulation and network
training alternate over multiple rounds. This strategy is particularly well
suited for high-precision inference in high-dimensional settings, which are
commonplace in physics applications with growing data volumes and increasing
model fidelity. Here, we introduce dynamic SBI, which implements the core ideas
of sequential methods in a round-free, asynchronous, and highly parallelisable
manner. At its core is an adaptive dataset that is iteratively transformed
during inference to resemble the target observation. Simulation and training
proceed in parallel: trained networks are used both to filter out simulations
incompatible with the data and to propose new, more promising ones. Compared to
round-based sequential methods, this asynchronous structure can significantly
reduce simulation costs and training overhead. We demonstrate that dynamic SBI
achieves significant improvements in simulation and training efficiency while
maintaining inference performance. We further validate our framework on two
challenging astrophysical inference tasks: characterising the stochastic
gravitational wave background and analysing strong gravitational lensing
systems. Overall, this work presents a flexible and efficient new paradigm for
sequential SBI.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15116v1"><h2>Polarization based direction of arrival estimation using a radio
  interferometric array</h2></a>Authors:  Sarod Yatawatta</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized
arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the
operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are
designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality
images of the sky.
  Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary
geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically
infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper,
we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio
interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full
array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is
suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the
proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency
interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the
detected RFI.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14102v1"><h2>Extracting latent representations from X-ray spectra. Classification,
  regression, and accretion signatures of Chandra sources</h2></a>Authors:  Nicolò Oreste Pinciroli Vago, Juan Rafael Martínez-Galarza, Roberta Amato</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>The study of X-ray spectra is crucial to understanding the physical nature of
astrophysical sources. Machine learning methods can extract compact and
informative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source
Catalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains
largely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and
physically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep
learning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant
information, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and
interpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress
X-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only
high-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary
statistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned
representation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering
performance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with
physical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density
($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent
variables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification
accuracy of $\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\sim$69% when
restricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover,
latent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes,
suggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant
information. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the
representation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent
space that supports both classification and the estimation of physical
properties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral
studies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.15198v1"><h2>HyperAIRI: a plug-and-play algorithm for precise hyperspectral image
  reconstruction in radio interferometry</h2></a>Authors:  Chao Tang, Arwa Dabbech, Adrian Jackson, Yves Wiaux</br>Comments: 18 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MNRAS</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, eess.IV</br><p>The next-generation radio-interferometric (RI) telescopes require imaging
algorithms capable of forming high-resolution high-dynamic-range images from
large data volumes spanning wide frequency bands. Recently, AIRI, a
plug-and-play (PnP) approach taking the forward-backward algorithmic structure
(FB), has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in monochromatic RI imaging
by alternating a data-fidelity step with a regularisation step via learned
denoisers. In this work, we introduce HyperAIRI, its hyperspectral extension,
underpinned by learned hyperspectral denoisers enforcing a power-law spectral
model. For each spectral channel, the HyperAIRI denoiser takes as input its
current image estimate, alongside estimates of its two immediate neighbouring
channels and the spectral index map, and provides as output its associated
denoised image. To ensure convergence of HyperAIRI, the denoisers are trained
with a Jacobian regularisation enforcing non-expansiveness. To accommodate
varying dynamic ranges, we assemble a shelf of pre-trained denoisers, each
tailored to a specific dynamic range. At each HyperAIRI iteration, the spectral
channels of the target image cube are updated in parallel using
dynamic-range-matched denoisers from the pre-trained shelf. The denoisers are
also endowed with a spatial image faceting functionality, enabling scalability
to varied image sizes. Additionally, we formally introduce Hyper-uSARA, a
variant of the optimisation-based algorithm HyperSARA, promoting joint sparsity
across spectral channels via the l2,1-norm, also adopting FB. We evaluate
HyperAIRI's performance on simulated and real observations. We showcase its
superior performance compared to its optimisation-based counterpart
Hyper-uSARA, CLEAN's hyperspectral variant in WSClean, and the monochromatic
imaging algorithms AIRI and uSARA.</p></br>
