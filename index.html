complements surface mapping provided by dedicated imagers, offering critical
insights into surface release processes, interactions within the planetary
environment, space weathering, and planetary evolution. This study explores the
feasibility of deriving Mercury's regolith elemental composition from in-situ
measurements of its neutral exosphere using deep neural networks (DNNs). We
present a supervised feed-forward DNN architecture - a multilayer perceptron
(MLP) - that, starting from exospheric densities and proton precipitation
fluxes, predicts the chemical elements of the surface regolith below. It serves
as an estimator for the surface-exosphere interaction and the processes leading
to exosphere formation. Because the DNN requires a comprehensive exospheric
dataset not available from previous missions, this study uses simulated
exosphere components and simulated drivers. Extensive training and testing
campaigns demonstrate the MLP's ability to accurately predict and reconstruct
surface composition maps from these simulated measurements. Although this
initial version does not aim to reproduce Mercury's actual surface composition,
it provides a proof of concept, showcasing the algorithm's robustness and
capacity for handling complex datasets to create estimators for exospheric
generation models. Moreover, our tests reveal substantial potential for further
development, suggesting that this method could significantly enhance the
analysis of complex surface-exosphere interactions and complement planetary
exosphere models. This work anticipates applying the approach to data from the
BepiColombo mission, specifically the SERENA package, whose nominal phase
begins in 2027.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.11910v1"><h2>Improving the discovery of near-Earth objects with machine-learning
  methods</h2></a>Authors:  Peter Vere≈°, Richard Cloete, Matthew J. Payne, Abraham Loeb</br>Comments: 13 pages, 16 figures, 11 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the digest2 parameters for candidates
of the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP) that were reported between
2019 and 2024. Our study proposes methods for significantly reducing the
inclusion of non-NEO objects on the NEOCP. Despite the substantial increase in
near-Earth object (NEO) discoveries in recent years, only about half of the
NEOCP candidates are ultimately confirmed as NEOs. Therefore, much observing
time is spent following up on non-NEOs. Furthermore, approximately 11% of the
candidates remain unconfirmed because the follow-up observations are
insufficient. These are nearly 600 cases per year. To reduce false positives
and minimize wasted resources on non-NEOs, we refine the posting criteria for
NEOCP based on a detailed analysis of all digest2 scores. We investigated 30
distinct digest2 parameter categories for candidates that were confirmed as
NEOs and non-NEOs. From this analysis, we derived a filtering mechanism based
on selected digest2 parameters that were able to exclude 20% of the non-NEOs
from the NEOCP while maintaining a minimal loss of true NEOs. We also
investigated the application of four machine-learning (ML) techniques, that is,
the gradient-boosting machine (GBM), the random forest (RF) classifier, the
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) classifier, and neural networks (NN) to
classify NEOCP candidates as NEOs or non-NEOs. Based on digest2 parameters as
input, our ML models achieved a precision of approximately 95% in
distinguishing between NEOs and non-NEOs. Results. Combining the digest2
parameter filter with an ML-based classification model, we demonstrate a
significant reduction in non-NEOs on the NEOCP that exceeds 80%, while limiting
the loss of NEO discovery tracklets to 5.5%. Importantly, we show that most
follow-up tracklets of initially misclassified NEOs are later correctly
identified as NEOs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14016v1"><h2>ThermoONet -- a deep learning-based small body thermophysical network:
  applications to modelling water activity of comets</h2></a>Authors:  Shunjing Zhao, Xian Shi, Hanlun Lei</br>Comments: accepted for publication in A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Cometary activity is a compelling subject of study, with thermophysical
models playing a pivotal role in its understanding. However, traditional
numerical solutions for small body thermophysical models are computationally
intensive, posing challenges for investigations requiring high-resolution or
repetitive modeling. To address this limitation, we employed a machine learning
approach to develop ThermoONet - a neural network designed to predict the
temperature and water ice sublimation flux of comets. Performance evaluations
indicate that ThermoONet achieves a low average error in subsurface temperature
of approximately 2% relative to the numerical simulation, while reducing
computational time by nearly six orders of magnitude. We applied ThermoONet to
model the water activity of comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and
21P/Giacobini-Zinner. By successfully fitting the water production rate curves
of these comets, as obtained by the Rosetta mission and the SOHO telescope,
respectively, we demonstrate the network's effectiveness and efficiency.
Furthermore, when combined with a global optimization algorithm, ThermoONet
proves capable of retrieving the physical properties of target bodies.</p></br>
