  sampling with Normalizing Flows</h2></a>Authors:  Eleonora Villa, Golam Mohiuddin Shaifullah, Andrea Possenti, Carmelita Carbone</br>Comments: 37 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables. Submitted to the Astronomy and
  Computing special issue HPC in Cosmology and Astrophysics</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, cs.LG</br><p>We present a detailed study of Bayesian inference workflows for pulsar timing
array data with a focus on enhancing efficiency, robustness and speed through
the use of normalizing flow-based nested sampling. Building on the Enterprise
framework, we integrate the i-nessai sampler and benchmark its performance on
realistic, simulated datasets. We analyze its computational scaling and
stability, and show that it achieves accurate posteriors and reliable evidence
estimates with substantially reduced runtime, by up to three orders of
magnitude depending on the dataset configuration, with respect to conventional
single-core parallel-tempering MCMC analyses. These results highlight the
potential of flow-based nested sampling to accelerate PTA analyses while
preserving the quality of the inference.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01959v1"><h2>Addressing prior dependence in hierarchical Bayesian modeling for PTA
  data analysis II: Noise and SGWB inference through parameter decorrelation</h2></a>Authors:  Eleonora Villa, Luigi D'Amico, Aldo Barca, Fatima Modica Bittordo, Francesco Alì, Massimo Meneghetti, Luca Naso</br>Comments: 18 pages, 7 figures. Submitted to the Astronomy and Computing special
  issue HPC in Cosmology and Astrophysics</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, cs.LG</br><p>Pulsar Timing Arrays provide a powerful framework to measure low-frequency
gravitational waves, but accuracy and robustness of the results are challenged
by complex noise processes that must be accurately modeled. Standard PTA
analyses assign fixed uniform noise priors to each pulsar, an approach that can
introduce systematic biases when combining the array. To overcome this
limitation, we adopt a hierarchical Bayesian modeling strategy in which noise
priors are parametrized by higher-level hyperparameters. We further address the
challenge posed by the correlations between hyperparameters and physical noise
parameters, focusing on those describing red noise and dispersion measure
variations. To decorrelate these quantities, we introduce an orthogonal
reparametrization of the hierarchical model implemented with Normalizing Flows.
We also employ i-nessai, a flow-guided nested sampler, to efficiently explore
the resulting higher-dimensional parameter space. We apply our method to a
minimal 3-pulsar case study, performing a simultaneous inference of noise and
SGWB parameters. Despite the limited dataset, the results consistently show
that the hierarchical treatment constrains the noise parameters more tightly
and partially alleviates the red-noise-SGWB degeneracy, while the orthogonal
reparametrization further enhances parameter independence without affecting the
correlations intrinsic to the power-law modeling of the physical processes
involved.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01352v1"><h2>MiniFool -- Physics-Constraint-Aware Minimizer-Based Adversarial Attacks
  in Deep Neural Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Lucie Flek, Oliver Janik, Philipp Alexander Jung, Akbar Karimi, Timo Saala, Alexander Schmidt, Matthias Schott, Philipp Soldin, Matthias Thiesmeyer, Christopher Wiebusch, Ulrich Willemsen</br>Comments: Submitted to Computing and Software for Big Science</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, hep-ex, physics.data-an, J.2; I.2.6</br><p>In this paper, we present a new algorithm, MiniFool, that implements
physics-inspired adversarial attacks for testing neural network-based
classification tasks in particle and astroparticle physics. While we initially
developed the algorithm for the search for astrophysical tau neutrinos with the
IceCube Neutrino Observatory, we apply it to further data from other science
domains, thus demonstrating its general applicability. Here, we apply the
algorithm to the well-known MNIST data set and furthermore, to Open Data data
from the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The algorithm is based on
minimizing a cost function that combines a $\chi^2$ based test-statistic with
the deviation from the desired target score. The test statistic quantifies the
probability of the perturbations applied to the data based on the experimental
uncertainties. For our studied use cases, we find that the likelihood of a
flipped classification differs for both the initially correctly and incorrectly
classified events. When testing changes of the classifications as a function of
an attack parameter that scales the experimental uncertainties, the robustness
of the network decision can be quantified. Furthermore, this allows testing the
robustness of the classification of unlabeled experimental data.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03173v1"><h2>Optimizing Earth-Moon Transfer and Cislunar Navigation: Integrating
  Low-Energy Trajectories, AI Techniques and GNSS-R Technologies</h2></a>Authors:  Arsalan Muhammad, Wasiu Akande Ahmed, Omada Friday Ojonugwa, Paul Puspendu Biswas</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO</br><p>The rapid growth of cislunar activities, including lunar landings, the Lunar
Gateway, and in-space refueling stations, requires advances in cost-efficient
trajectory design and reliable integration of navigation and remote sensing.
Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high
propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no
coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental
awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer
strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel
efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic
missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is
highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition
and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables
adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and
decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced
Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation
capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for
mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems
support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated
satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable
framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic
presence.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00834v1"><h2>Reconstruction of Black Hole Ringdown Signals with Data Gaps using a
  Deep-Learning Framework</h2></a>Authors:  Jing-Qi Lai, Jia-Geng Jiao, Cai-Ying Shao, Jun-Xi Shi, Yu Tian</br>Comments: 15 pages, 12 figures. Code (research prototype) available at:
  https://github.com/ljq2088/RingdownGapFilling/tree/master</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>We introduce DenoiseGapFiller (DGF), a deep-learning framework specifically
designed to reconstruct gravitational-wave ringdown signals corrupted by data
gaps and instrumental noise. DGF employs a dual-branch encoder-decoder
architecture, which is fused via mixing layers and Transformer-style blocks.
Trained end-to-end on synthetic ringdown waveforms with gaps up to 20% of the
segment length, DGF can achieve a mean waveform mismatch of 0.002. The residual
amplitudes of the Time-domain shrink by roughly an order of magnitude and the
power spectral density in the 0.01-1 Hz band is suppressed by 1-2 orders of
magnitude, restoring the peak of quasi-normal mode(QNM) in the time-frequency
representation around 0.01-0.1 Hz. The ability of the model to faithfully
reconstruct the original signals, which implies milder penalties in the
detection evidence and tighter credible regions for parameter estimation, lay a
foundation for the following scientific work.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03636v1"><h2>Quantifying Weighted Morphological Content of Large-Scale Structures via
  Simulation-Based Inference</h2></a>Authors:  M. H. Jalali Kanafi, S. M. S. Movahed</br>Comments: 19 pages, 9 figures and 3 tables. Comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, physics.comp-ph</br><p>In this work, we perform a simulation-based forecasting analysis to compare
the constraining power of two higher-order summary statistics of the
large-scale structure (LSS), the Minkowski Functionals (MFs) and the
Conditional Moments of Derivative (CMD), with a particular focus on their
sensitivity to nonlinear and anisotropic features in redshift-space. Our
analysis relies on halo catalogs from the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ) simulations
at redshift $z=0.5$, employing a likelihood-free inference framework
implemented via neural posterior estimation. At the fiducial cosmology of the
Quijote simulations $(\Omega_{m}=0.3175,\,\sigma_{8}=0.834)$, and for the
smoothing scale $R=15\,h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that the CMD yields tighter
forecasts for $(\Omega_{m}},\,\sigma_{8})$ than the zeroth- to third-order MFs
components, improving the constraint precision by ${\sim}(44\%,\,52\%)$,
${\sim}(30\%,\,45\%)$, ${\sim}(27\%,\,17\%)$, and ${\sim}(26\%,\,17\%)$,
respectively. A joint configuration combining the MFs and CMD further enhances
the precision by approximately ${\sim}27\%$ compared to the standard MFs alone,
highlighting the complementary anisotropy-sensitive information captured by the
CMD in contrast to the scalar morphological content encapsulated by the MFs. We
further extend the forecasting analysis to a continuous range of cosmological
parameter values and multiple smoothing scales. Our results show that, although
the absolute forecast uncertainty for each component of summary statistics
depends on the underlying parameter values and the adopted smoothing scale, the
relative constraining power among the summary statistics remains nearly
constant throughout.</p></br>
