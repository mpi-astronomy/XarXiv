  Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Juan Calles, Jacky H. T. Yip, Gabriella Contardo, Jorge Nore√±a, Adam Rouhiainen, Gary Shiu</br>Comments: 28 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><p>Building upon [2308.02636], this article investigates the potential
constraining power of persistent homology for cosmological parameters and
primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes in a likelihood-free inference pipeline.
We evaluate the ability of persistence images (PIs) to infer parameters,
compared to the combined Power Spectrum and Bispectrum (PS/BS), and we compare
two types of models: neural-based, and tree-based. PIs consistently lead to
better predictions compared to the combined PS/BS when the parameters can be
constrained (i.e., for $\{\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, n_{\rm s}, f_{\rm NL}^{\rm
loc}\}$). PIs perform particularly well for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, showing the
promise of persistent homology in constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. Our
results show that combining PIs with PS/BS provides only marginal gains,
indicating that the PS/BS contains little extra or complementary information to
the PIs. Finally, we provide a visualization of the most important topological
features for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and for $\Omega_{\rm m}$. This reveals that
clusters and voids (0-cycles and 2-cycles) are most informative for
$\Omega_{\rm m}$, while $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ uses the filaments (1-cycles) in
addition to the other two types of topological features.</p></br>
