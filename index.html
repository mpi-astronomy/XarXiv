scientific domains, motivating our exploration of their potential in solar
physics. In this paper, we present Solaris, the first foundation model for
forecasting the Sun's atmosphere. We leverage 13 years of full-disk,
multi-wavelength solar imagery from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, spanning a
complete solar cycle, to pre-train Solaris for 12-hour interval forecasting.
Solaris is built on a large-scale 3D Swin Transformer architecture with 109
million parameters. We demonstrate Solaris' ability to generalize by
fine-tuning on a low-data regime using a single wavelength (1700 {\AA}), that
was not included in pre-training, outperforming models trained from scratch on
this specific wavelength. Our results indicate that Solaris can effectively
capture the complex dynamics of the solar atmosphere and transform solar
forecasting.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16556v1"><h2>Anomaly Detection and RFI Classification with Unsupervised Learning in
  Narrowband Radio Technosignature Searches</h2></a>Authors:  Ben Jacobson-Bell, Steve Croft, Carmen Choza, Alex Andersson, Daniel Bautista, Vishal Gajjar, Matthew Lebofsky, David H. E. MacMahon, Caleb Painter, Andrew P. V. Siemion</br>Comments: 20 pages, 14 figures, submitted to AJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The search for radio technosignatures is an anomaly detection problem:
candidate signals represent needles of interest in the proverbial haystack of
radio-frequency interference (RFI). Current search frameworks find an enormity
of false-positive signals, especially in large surveys, requiring manual
follow-up to a sometimes prohibitive degree. Unsupervised learning provides an
algorithmic way to winnow the most anomalous signals from the chaff, as well as
group together RFI signals that bear morphological similarities. We present
GLOBULAR (Grouping Low-frequency Observations By Unsupervised Learning After
Reduction) clustering, a signal processing method that uses HDBSCAN to reduce
the false-positive rate and isolate outlier signals for further analysis. When
combined with a standard narrowband signal detection and spatial filtering
pipeline, such as turboSETI, GLOBULAR clustering offers significant
improvements in the false-positive rate over the standard pipeline alone,
suggesting dramatic potential for the amelioration of manual follow-up
requirements for future large surveys. By removing RFI signals in regions of
high spectral occupancy, GLOBULAR clustering may also enable the detection of
signals missed by the standard pipeline. We benchmark our method against the
Choza et al. (2024) turboSETI-only search of 97 nearby galaxies at L-band,
demonstrating a false-positive hit reduction rate of 93.1% and a false-positive
event reduction rate of 99.3%.</p></br>
