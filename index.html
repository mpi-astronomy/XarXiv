  Model Approach</h2></a>Authors:  Francesco Pio Ramunno, Paolo Massa, Vitaliy Kinakh, Brandon Panos, Andr√© Csillaghy, Slava Voloshynovskiy</br>Comments: Accepted for publication on A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The spatial properties of the solar magnetic field are crucial to decoding
the physical processes in the solar interior and their interplanetary effects.
However, observations from older instruments, such as the Michelson Doppler
Imager (MDI), have limited spatial or temporal resolution, which hinders the
ability to study small-scale solar features in detail. Super resolving these
older datasets is essential for uniform analysis across different solar cycles,
enabling better characterization of solar flares, active regions, and magnetic
network dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion model approach
for Super-Resolution and we apply it to MDI magnetograms to match the
higher-resolution capabilities of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI).
By training a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with residuals on downscaled HMI
data and fine-tuning it with paired MDI/HMI data, we can enhance the resolution
of MDI observations from 2"/pixel to 0.5"/pixel. We evaluate the quality of the
reconstructed images by means of classical metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, FID and
LPIPS) and we check if physical properties, such as the unsigned magnetic flux
or the size of an active region, are preserved. We compare our model with
different variations of LDM and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models
(DDPMs), but also with two deterministic architectures already used in the past
for performing the Super-Resolution task. Furthermore, we show with an analysis
in the Fourier domain that the LDM with residuals can resolve features smaller
than 2", and due to the probabilistic nature of the LDM, we can asses their
reliability, in contrast with the deterministic models. Future studies aim to
super-resolve the temporal scale of the solar MDI instrument so that we can
also have a better overview of the dynamics of the old events.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23202v1"><h2>Using Wavelet Decomposition to Determine the Dimension of Structures
  from Projected Images</h2></a>Authors:  Svitlana Mayboroda, David N Spergel</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.HE</br>All Categories: astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.GA, math.AP, physics.data-an</br><p>Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across
a wide range of scales. We consider a $\gamma$ dimensional measure embedded in
an $N$ dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in
$N$ dimensions and projected into $D$ dimensions.
  It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower
dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are
space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the
Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we
demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing
objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably
simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected $\gamma$ dimensional measure
is $P_j \propto 2^{-j\gamma}$. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension,
$N$, and the projected dimension, $D$. This approach could have potentially
broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes
lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field
and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space.
  Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby
supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections
of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from $\gamma = 1.7$
for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to $\gamma = 2.5$ for the hot X-ray
emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates
that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure
likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding
supernova shell.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22617v1"><h2>Using Machine Learning for Lunar Mineralogy-I: Hyperspectral Imaging of
  Volcanic Samples</h2></a>Authors:  Fatemeh Fazel Hesar, Mojtaba Raouf, Peyman Soltani, Bernard Foing, Michiel J. A. de Dood, Fons J. Verbeek, Esther Cheng, Chenming Zhou</br>Comments: 18 pages, 7 Figure, Accepted to the Special Issue: Planetary Radar
  Astronomy - Universe: Planetary Sciences Journal</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>This study examines the mineral composition of volcanic samples similar to
lunar materials, focusing on olivine and pyroxene. Using hyperspectral imaging
from 400 to 1000 nm, we created data cubes to analyze the reflectance
characteristics of samples from samples from Vulcano, a volcanically active
island in the Aeolian Archipelago, north of Sicily, Italy, categorizing them
into nine regions of interest and analyzing spectral data for each. We applied
various unsupervised clustering algorithms, including K-Means, Hierarchical
Clustering, GMM, and Spectral Clustering, to classify the spectral profiles.
Principal Component Analysis revealed distinct spectral signatures associated
with specific minerals, facilitating precise identification. Clustering
performance varied by region, with K-Means achieving the highest
silhouette-score of 0.47, whereas GMM performed poorly with a score of only
0.25. Non-negative Matrix Factorization aided in identifying similarities among
clusters across different methods and reference spectra for olivine and
pyroxene. Hierarchical clustering emerged as the most reliable technique,
achieving a 94\% similarity with the olivine spectrum in one sample, whereas
GMM exhibited notable variability. Overall, the analysis indicated that both
Hierarchical and K-Means methods yielded lower errors in total measurements,
with K-Means demonstrating superior performance in estimated dispersion and
clustering. Additionally, GMM showed a higher root mean square error compared
to the other models. The RMSE analysis confirmed K-Means as the most consistent
algorithm across all samples, suggesting a predominance of olivine in the
Vulcano region relative to pyroxene. This predominance is likely linked to
historical formation conditions similar to volcanic processes on the Moon,
where olivine-rich compositions are common in ancient lava flows and impact
melt rocks.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23015v1"><h2>Engineering Microbial Symbiosis for Mars Habitability</h2></a>Authors:  Randall R. Correll, Simon P. Worden</br>Comments: 25 pages, 1 figure</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>The colonization of Mars presents extraordinary challenges, including
radiation exposure, low atmospheric pressure, and toxic regolith. Recent
advancements in synthetic biology and genetic engineering offer unprecedented
opportunities to address these obstacles by utilizing terrestrial extremophiles
and engineered organisms. This paper examines the potential for creating
symbiotic relationships between terrestrial microbes and hypothetical Martian
life forms, should they exist, to support a sustainable human presence on Mars.
Inspired by natural examples of endosymbiosis, such as mitochondria and
chloroplasts, we propose methods to engineer life forms capable of enduring
Martian conditions. Key components include experimental designs, laboratory
simulations, and bioengineering approaches essential to this endeavor. The
ethical, political, and technological challenges of introducing engineered life
to Mars are critically evaluated, with an emphasis on international
collaboration and robust planetary protection policies. This research
underscores engineered symbiosis as a transformative strategy for enabling life
to adapt and thrive on Mars while advancing humanity's aspirations for
interplanetary habitation and exploration. By addressing these challenges, this
work highlights a path toward sustainable life on Mars, reflecting both
scientific ingenuity and ethical stewardship.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21734v1"><h2>Structure and Melting of Fe, MgO, SiO2, and MgSiO3 in Planets: Database,

5,000 GPa for four fundamental planetary materials, Fe, MgO, SiO2, and MgSiO3,
derived from logistic regression and supervised learning, together with an
experimental phase equilibria database. These new P-T phase diagrams provide a
solution to long-standing disputes about their melting curves. Their
implications extend to the melting and freezing of rocky materials in the
interior of giant planets and super-Earth exoplanets, contributing to the
refinement of their internal structure models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23686v1"><h2>Data-Driven Forecasting of High-Dimensional Transient and Stationary
  Processes via Space-Time Projection</h2></a>Authors:  Oliver T. Schmidt</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.GA, nlin.CD, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an, physics.flu-dyn</br><p>Space-Time Projection (STP) is introduced as a data-driven forecasting
approach for high-dimensional and time-resolved data. The method computes
extended space-time proper orthogonal modes from training data spanning a
prediction horizon comprising both hindcast and forecast intervals. Forecasts
are then generated by projecting the hindcast portion of these modes onto new
data, simultaneously leveraging their orthogonality and optimal correlation
with the forecast extension. Rooted in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
theory, dimensionality reduction and time-delay embedding are intrinsic to the
approach. For a given ensemble and fixed prediction horizon, the only tunable
parameter is the truncation rank--no additional hyperparameters are required.
The hindcast accuracy serves as a reliable indicator for short-term forecast
accuracy and establishes a lower bound on forecast errors. The efficacy of the
method is demonstrated using two datasets: transient, highly anisotropic
simulations of supernova explosions in a turbulent interstellar medium, and
experimental velocity fields of a turbulent high-subsonic engineering flow. In
a comparative study with standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
networks--acknowledging that alternative architectures or training strategies
may yield different outcomes--the method consistently provided more accurate
forecasts. Considering its simplicity and robust performance, STP offers an
interpretable and competitive benchmark for forecasting high-dimensional
transient and chaotic processes, relying purely on spatiotemporal correlation
information.</p></br>
