evolutionary models. By interpreting the input parameters and output properties
of these models as multi-dimensional probability distributions, we train
conditional normalizing flows to learn and predict the complex relationships
between grid inputs and outputs in the form of conditional joint distributions.
Leveraging the expressive power and versatility of these flows, we showcase
their ability to emulate a variety of evolutionary tracks and isochrones across
a continuous range of input parameters. In addition, we describe a simple
Bayesian approach for estimating stellar parameters using these flows and
demonstrate its application to asteroseismic datasets of red giants observed by
the Kepler mission. By applying this approach to red giants in open clusters
NGC 6791 and NGC 6819, we illustrate how large age uncertainties can arise when
fitting only to global asteroseismic and spectroscopic parameters without prior
information on initial helium abundances and mixing length parameter values. We
also conduct inference using the flow at a large scale by determining revised
estimates of masses and radii for 15,388 field red giants. These estimates show
improved agreement with results from existing grid-based modelling, reveal
distinct population-level features in the red clump, and suggest that the
masses of Kepler red giants previously determined using the corrected
asteroseismic scaling relations have been overestimated by 5-10%.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07229v1"><h2>Using Galaxy Evolution as Source of Physics-Based Ground Truth for
  Generative Models</h2></a>Authors:  Yun Qi Li, Tuan Do, Evan Jones, Bernie Boscoe, Kevin Alfaro, Zooey Nguyen</br>Comments: 20 pages, 14 figures, 1 Table, code:

  https://zenodo.org/records/11117528</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Generative models producing images have enormous potential to advance
discoveries across scientific fields and require metrics capable of quantifying
the high dimensional output. We propose that astrophysics data, such as galaxy
images, can test generative models with additional physics-motivated ground
truths in addition to human judgment. For example, galaxies in the Universe
form and change over billions of years, following physical laws and
relationships that are both easy to characterize and difficult to encode in
generative models. We build a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) and a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and test their
ability to generate realistic galaxies conditioned on their redshifts (galaxy
ages). This is one of the first studies to probe these generative models using
physically motivated metrics. We find that both models produce comparable
realistic galaxies based on human evaluation, but our physics-based metrics are
better able to discern the strengths and weaknesses of the generative models.
Overall, the DDPM model performs better than the CVAE on the majority of the
physics-based metrics. Ultimately, if we can show that generative models can
learn the physics of galaxy evolution, they have the potential to unlock new
astrophysical discoveries.</p></br>
