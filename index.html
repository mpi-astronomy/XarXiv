  Rotation</h2></a>Authors:  Fatemeh Fazel Hesar, Bernard Foing, Ana M. Heras, Mojtaba Raouf, Victoria Foing, Shima Javanmardi, Fons J. Verbeek</br>Comments: 15 pages, 8 figures. Submitted for publication in A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>This study applied machine learning models to estimate stellar rotation
periods from corrected light curve data obtained by the NASA Kepler mission.
Traditional methods often struggle to estimate rotation periods accurately due
to noise and variability in the light curve data. The workflow involved using
initial period estimates from the LS-Periodogram and Transit Least Squares
techniques, followed by splitting the data into training, validation, and
testing sets. We employed several machine learning algorithms, including
Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting, and
also utilized a Voting Ensemble approach to improve prediction accuracy and
robustness.
  The analysis included data from multiple Kepler IDs, providing detailed
metrics on orbital periods and planet radii. Performance evaluation showed that
the Voting Ensemble model yielded the most accurate results, with an RMSE
approximately 50\% lower than the Decision Tree model and 17\% better than the
K-Nearest Neighbors model. The Random Forest model performed comparably to the
Voting Ensemble, indicating high accuracy. In contrast, the Gradient Boosting
model exhibited a worse RMSE compared to the other approaches. Comparisons of
the predicted rotation periods to the photometric reference periods showed
close alignment, suggesting the machine learning models achieved high
prediction accuracy. The results indicate that machine learning, particularly
ensemble methods, can effectively solve the problem of accurately estimating
stellar rotation periods, with significant implications for advancing the study
of exoplanets and stellar astrophysics.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07523v1"><h2>Using Neural Network Models to Estimate Stellar Ages from Lithium
  Equivalent Widths: An EAGLES Expansion</h2></a>Authors:  George Weaver, Robin D. Jeffries, Richard J. Jackson</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical
  Society. Code available at https://github.com/robdjeff/eagles. Electronic
  tables are available from the author</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We present an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model of photospheric lithium
depletion in cool stars (3000 < Teff / K < 6500), producing estimates and
probability distributions of age from Li I 6708A equivalent width (LiEW) and
effective temperature data inputs. The model is trained on the same sample of
6200 stars from 52 open clusters, observed in the Gaia-ESO spectroscopic
survey, and used to calibrate the previously published analytical EAGLES model,
with ages 2 - 6000 Myr and -0.3 < [Fe/H] < 0.2. The additional flexibility of
the ANN provides some improvements, including better modelling of the "lithium
dip" at ages < 50 Myr and Teff ~ 3500K, and of the intrinsic dispersion in LiEW
at all ages. Poor age discrimination is still an issue at ages > 1 Gyr,
confirming that additional modelling flexibility is not sufficient to fully
represent the LiEW - age - Teff relationship, and suggesting the involvement of
further astrophysical parameters. Expansion to include such parameters -
rotation, accretion, and surface gravity - is discussed, and the use of an ANN
means these can be more easily included in future iterations, alongside more
flexible functional forms for the LiEW dispersion. Our methods and ANN model
are provided in an updated version 2.0 of the EAGLES software.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07957v1"><h2>Rapid Parameter Estimation for Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals Using
  Machine Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Bo Liang, Hong Guo, Tianyu Zhao, He wang, Herik Evangelinelis, Yuxiang Xu, Chang liu, Manjia Liang, Xiaotong Wei, Yong Yuan, Peng Xu, Minghui Du, Wei-Liang Qian, Ziren Luo</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: physics.comp-ph</br>All Categories: physics.comp-ph, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>Extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) signals pose significant challenges in
gravitational wave (GW) astronomy owing to their low-frequency nature and
highly complex waveforms, which occupy a high-dimensional parameter space with
numerous variables. Given their extended inspiral timescales and low
signal-to-noise ratios, EMRI signals warrant prolonged observation periods.
Parameter estimation becomes particularly challenging due to non-local
parameter degeneracies, arising from multiple local maxima, as well as flat
regions and ridges inherent in the likelihood function. These factors lead to
exceptionally high time complexity for parameter analysis while employing
traditional matched filtering and random sampling methods. To address these
challenges, the present study applies machine learning to Bayesian posterior
estimation of EMRI signals, leveraging the recently developed flow matching
technique based on ODE neural networks. Our approach demonstrates computational
efficiency several orders of magnitude faster than the traditional Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, while preserving the unbiasedness of parameter
estimation. We show that machine learning technology has the potential to
efficiently handle the vast parameter space, involving up to seventeen
parameters, associated with EMRI signals. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this
is the first instance of applying machine learning, specifically the Continuous
Normalizing Flows (CNFs), to EMRI signal analysis. Our findings highlight the
promising potential of machine learning in EMRI waveform analysis, offering new
perspectives for the advancement of space-based GW detection and GW astronomy.</p></br>
