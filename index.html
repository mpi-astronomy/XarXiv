  Disk Properties Around Young Stars</h2></a>Authors:  Sayed Shafaat Mahmud, Sayantan Auddy, Neal Turner, Jeffrey S. Bary</br>Comments: 6 pages, 5 figures, Accepted and Published at International
  Conference on Machine Learning, Machine Learning for Astrophysics Workshop
  2025</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We present \textbf{VADER} (Variational Autoencoder for Disks Embedded with
Rings), for inferring both planet mass and global disk properties from
high-resolution ALMA dust continuum images of protoplanetary disks (PPDs).
VADER, a probabilistic deep learning model, enables uncertainty-aware inference
of planet masses, $\alpha$-viscosity, dust-to-gas ratio, Stokes number, flaring
index, and the number of planets directly from protoplanetary disk images.
VADER is trained on over 100{,}000 synthetic images of PPDs generated from
\texttt{FARGO3D} simulations post-processed with \texttt{RADMC3D}. Our trained
model predicts physical planet and disk parameters with $R^2 > 0.9$ from dust
continuum images of PPDs. Applied to 23 real disks, VADER's mass estimates are
consistent with literature values and reveal latent correlations that reflect
known disk physics. Our results establish VAE-based generative models as robust
tools for probabilistic astrophysical inference, with direct applications to
interpreting protoplanetary disk substructures in the era of large
interferometric surveys.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12929v1"><h2>Quantum Computing Tools for Fast Detection of Gravitational Waves in the
  Context of LISA Space Mission</h2></a>Authors:  Maria-Catalina Isfan, Laurentiu-Ioan Caramete, Ana Caramete, Daniel Tonoiu, Alexandru Nicolin-Zaczek</br>Comments: Submitted to Classical and Quantum Gravity</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>The field of gravitational wave (GW) detection is progressing rapidly, with
several next-generation observatories on the horizon, including LISA. GW data
is challenging to analyze due to highly variable signals shaped by source
properties and the presence of complex noise. These factors emphasize the need
for robust, advanced analysis tools. In this context, we have initiated the
development of a low-latency GW detection pipeline based on quantum neural
networks (QNNs). Previously, we demonstrated that QNNs can recognize GWs
simulated using post-Newtonian approximations in the Newtonian limit. We then
extended this work using data from the LISA Consortium, training QNNs to
distinguish between noisy GW signals and pure noise. Currently, we are
evaluating performance on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset and comparing
it against classical methods. Our results show that QNNs can reliably
distinguish GW signals embedded in noise, achieving classification accuracies
above 98\%. Notably, our QNN identified 5 out of 6 mergers in the Sangria blind
dataset. The remaining merger, characterized by the lowest amplitude,
highlights an area for future improvement in model sensitivity. This can
potentially be addressed using additional mock training datasets, which we are
preparing, and by testing different QNN architectures and ansatzes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10198v1"><h2>Bertrand's Representation of the Optimal Detector</h2></a>Authors:  Vladimir Lenok</br>Comments: submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</br>Primary Category: physics.data-an</br>All Categories: physics.data-an, astro-ph.IM</br><p>It is shown how the optimal detector of Gaussian signals can be represented
in terms of Bertrand's class of time-frequency distributions. In this
representation, the detector is a correlation between the corresponding
time-frequency distributions. Since Bertrand's class is related to the
power-law chirp signals, the new representation can be useful for their
detection. The new approach is shown to be more effective then other
time-frequency methods for the case of phase-insensitive detection. The finding
provides a complementary representation to Cohen's class representation in the
time-frequency domain already known in the literature.</p></br>
