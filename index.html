  Satellite Collision Avoidance</h2></a>Authors:  Francesca Ferrara, Lander W. Schillinger Arana, Florian DÃ¶rfler, Sarah H. Q. Li</br>Comments: 16 pages, 13 figures, submitted to the 2025 Astrodynamics Specialist
  Conference</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.ET</br><p>This work presents a Markov decision process (MDP) framework to model
decision-making for collision avoidance maneuver (CAM) and a reinforcement
learning policy gradient (RL-PG) algorithm to train an autonomous guidance
policy using historic CAM data. In addition to maintaining acceptable collision
risks, this approach seeks to minimize the average fuel consumption of CAMs by
making early maneuver decisions. We model CAM as a continuous state, discrete
action and finite horizon MDP, where the critical decision is determining when
to initiate the maneuver. The MDP model also incorporates analytical models for
conjunction risk, propellant consumption, and transit orbit geometry. The
Markov policy effectively trades-off maneuver delay-which improves the
reliability of conjunction risk indicators-with propellant consumption-which
increases with decreasing maneuver time. Using historical data of tracked
conjunction events, we verify this framework and conduct an extensive ablation
study on the hyper-parameters used within the MDP. On synthetic conjunction
events, the trained policy significantly minimizes both the overall and average
propellant consumption per CAM when compared to a conventional cut-off policy
that initiates maneuvers 24 hours before the time of closest approach (TCA). On
historical conjunction events, the trained policy consumes more propellant
overall but reduces the average propellant consumption per CAM. For both
historical and synthetic conjunction events, the trained policy achieves equal
if not higher overall collision risk guarantees.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07065v1"><h2>Reconstruction of Solar EUV Irradiance Using CaII K Images and SOHO/SEM
  Data with Bayesian Deep Learning and Uncertainty Quantification</h2></a>Authors:  Haodi Jiang, Qin Li, Jason T. L. Wang, Haimin Wang, Serena Criscuoli</br>Comments: 18 pages, 10 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance plays a crucial role in heating
the Earth's ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere, affecting atmospheric
dynamics over varying time scales. Although significant effort has been spent
studying short-term EUV variations from solar transient events, there is little
work to explore the long-term evolution of the EUV flux over multiple solar
cycles. Continuous EUV flux measurements have only been available since 1995,
leaving significant gaps in earlier data. In this study, we propose a Bayesian
deep learning model, named SEMNet, to fill the gaps. We validate our approach
by applying SEMNet to construct SOHO/SEM EUV flux measurements in the period
between 1998 and 2014 using CaII K images from the Precision Solar Photometric
Telescope. We then extend SEMNet through transfer learning to reconstruct solar
EUV irradiance in the period between 1950 and 1960 using CaII K images from the
Kodaikanal Solar Observatory. Experimental results show that SEMNet provides
reliable predictions along with uncertainty bounds, demonstrating the
feasibility of CaII K images as a robust proxy for long-term EUV fluxes. These
findings contribute to a better understanding of solar influences on Earth's
climate over extended periods.</p></br>
