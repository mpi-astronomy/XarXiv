  Precise chemical abundances with neural networks</h2></a>Authors:  Giulia Martos, Jorge Meléndez, Lorenzo Spina, Sara Lucatello</br>Comments: Accepted by A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG, cs.NE</br><p>The aim of this work is to obtain precise atmospheric parameters and chemical
abundances automatically for solar twins and analogs to find signatures of
exoplanets, as well as to assess how peculiar the Sun is compared to these
stars and to analyze any possible fine structures in the Galactic thin disk. We
developed a neural network (NN) algorithm using Python to obtain these
parameters for a sample of 99 solar twins and solar analogs previously studied
in the literature from normalized high-quality spectra from HARPS, with a
resolving power of R $\sim$ 115000 and a signal-to-noise ratio S/N > 400. We
obtained precise atmospheric parameters and abundance ratios [X/Fe] of 20
chemical elements (Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni,
Cu, Zn, Y, and Ba). The results are in line with the literature, with average
differences and standard deviations of $(2 \pm 27)$ K for T$_{\rm eff}$, $(0.00
\pm 0.06)$ dex for log g, $(0.00 \pm 0.02)$ dex for [Fe/H], $(-0.01 \pm 0.05)$
km s$^{-1}$ for microturbulence velocity, $(0.02 \pm 0.08)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the
macro turbulence velocity, and $(-0.12 \pm 0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$ for the projected
rotational velocity (vsin$i$). Regarding the chemical abundances, most of the
elements agree with the literature within 0.01 - 0.02 dex. The abundances were
corrected from the effects of the Galactic chemical evolution and analyzed with
the condensation temperature (T$_{\rm cond}$) to verify whether the stars
presented depletion of refractories compared to volatiles. We found that the
Sun is more depleted in refractory elements compared to volatiles than 89% of
the studied solar analogs, with a significance of 9.5$\sigma$ when compared to
the stars without detected exoplanets. We also found the possible presence of
three subpopulations in the solar analogs: one Cu-rich, one Cu-poor, and the
last one slightly older and poor in Na.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21869v1"><h2>Glitches far from transient gravitational-wave events do not bias
  inference</h2></a>Authors:  Sophie Hourihane, Katerina Chatziioannou</br>Comments: 14 pages, 7 figures</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detectors, known as "glitches," can
bias the inferred parameters of transient signals when they occur nearby in
time and frequency. These biases are addressed with a variety of methods that
remove or otherwise mitigate the impact of the glitch. Given the computational
cost and human effort required for glitch mitigation, we study the conditions
under which it is strictly necessary. We consider simulated glitches and
gravitational-wave signals in various configurations that probe their proximity
both in time and in frequency. We determine that glitches located outside the
time-frequency space spanned by the gravitational-wave model prior and with a
signal-to-noise ratio, conservatively, below 50 do not impact estimation of the
signal parameters.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20729v1"><h2>Test-time Scaling Techniques in Theoretical Physics -- A Comparison of
  Methods on the TPBench Dataset</h2></a>Authors:  Zhiqi Gao, Tianyi Li, Yurii Kvasiuk, Sai Chaitanya Tadepalli, Maja Rudolph, Daniel J. H. Chung, Frederic Sala, Moritz Münchmeyer</br>Comments: 23 pages, 6 figures</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.CO, cs.AI, hep-ph, hep-th</br><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in complex
reasoning, and test-time scaling techniques can enhance their performance with
comparably low cost. Many of these methods have been developed and evaluated on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks such as AIME. This paper investigates whether
the lessons learned from these benchmarks generalize to the domain of advanced
theoretical physics. We evaluate a range of common test-time scaling methods on
the TPBench physics dataset and compare their effectiveness with results on
AIME. To better leverage the structure of physics problems, we develop a novel,
symbolic weak-verifier framework to improve parallel scaling results. Our
empirical results demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms
existing test-time scaling approaches on TPBench. We also evaluate our method
on AIME, confirming its effectiveness in solving advanced mathematical
problems. Our findings highlight the power of step-wise symbolic verification
for tackling complex scientific problems.</p></br>
