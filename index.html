  using Generative Adversarial Neural Networks</h2></a>Authors:  Minia Manteiga, Raúl Santoveña, Marco A. Álvarez, Carlos Dafonte, Manuel G. Penedo, Silvana Navarro, Luis Corral</br>Comments: 9 pages, 8 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>A method based on Generative Adversaria! Networks (GANs) is developed for
disentangling the physical (effective temperature and gravity) and chemical
(metallicity, overabundance of a-elements with respect to iron) atmospheric
properties in astronomical spectra. Using a projection of the stellar spectra,
commonly called latent space, in which the contribution dueto one or several
main stellar physicochemical properties is minimised while others are enhanced,
it was possible to maximise the information related to certain properties,
which can then be extracted using artificial neural networks (ANN) as
regressors with higher accuracy than a reference method based on the use of ANN
trained with the original spectra. Methods. Our model utilises autoencoders,
comprising two artificial neural networks: an encoder anda decoder which
transform input data into a low-dimensional representation known as latent
space. It also uses discriminators, which are additional neural networks aimed
at transforming the traditional autoencoder training into an adversaria!
approach, to disentangle or reinforce the astrophysical parameters from the
latent space. The GANDALF tool is described. It was developed to define, train,
and test our GAN model with a web framework to show how the disentangling
algorithm works visually. It is open to the community in Github. Results. The
performance of our approach for retrieving atmospheric stellar properties from
spectra is demonstrated using Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrograph (RVS) data from
DR3. We use a data-driven perspective and obtain very competitive values, ali
within the literature errors, and with the advantage of an important
dimensionality reduction of the data to be processed.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10594v1"><h2>Accurate and thermodynamically consistent hydrogen equation of state for
  planetary modeling with flow matching</h2></a>Authors:  Hao Xie, Saburo Howard, Guglielmo Mazzola</br>Comments: 7+7 pages, 4+9 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG, physics.comp-ph</br><p>Accurate determination of the equation of state of dense hydrogen is
essential for understanding gas giants. Currently, there is still no consensus
on methods for calculating its entropy, which play a fundamental role and can
result in qualitatively different predictions for Jupiter's interior. Here, we
investigate various aspects of entropy calculation for dense hydrogen based on
ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we employ the recently
developed flow matching method to validate the accuracy of the traditional
thermodynamic integration approach. We then clearly identify pitfalls in
previous attempts and propose a reliable framework for constructing the
hydrogen equation of state, which is accurate and thermodynamically consistent
across a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. This allows us to
conclusively address the long-standing discrepancies in Jupiter's adiabat among
earlier studies, demonstrating the potential of our approach for providing
reliable equations of state of diverse materials.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10486v1"><h2>Enhancing the Reliability in Machine Learning for Gravitational Wave
  Parameter Estimation with Attention-Based Models</h2></a>Authors:  Hibiki Iwanaga, Mahoro Matsuyama, Yousuke Itoh</br>Comments: 9 pages, 14 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, gr-qc</br><p>We introduce a technique to enhance the reliability of gravitational wave
parameter estimation results produced by machine learning. We develop two
independent machine learning models based on the Vision Transformer to estimate
effective spin and chirp mass from spectrograms of gravitational wave signals
from binary black hole mergers. To enhance the reliability of these models, we
utilize attention maps to visualize the areas our models focus on when making
predictions. This approach enables demonstrating that both models perform
parameter estimation based on physically meaningful information. Furthermore,
by leveraging these attention maps, we demonstrate a method to quantify the
impact of glitches on parameter estimation. We show that as the models focus
more on glitches, the parameter estimation results become more strongly biased.
This suggests that attention maps could potentially be used to distinguish
between cases where the results produced by the machine learning model are
reliable and cases where they are not.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11657v1"><h2>Classification of HI Galaxy Profiles Using Unsupervised Learning and
  Convolutional Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis and Methodological
  Cases of Studies</h2></a>Authors:  Gabriel Jaimes-Illanes, Manuel Parra-Royon, Laura Darriba-Pol, Javier Moldón, Amidou Sorgho, Susana Sánchez-Expósito, Julián Garrido-Sánchez, Lourdes Verdes-Montenegro</br>Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is crucial for
understanding galaxy formation and evolution. The 21 cm neutral atomic hydrogen
- HI spectral line maps the gas kinematics within galaxies, providing key
insights into interactions, galactic structure, and star formation processes.
With new radio instruments, the volume and complexity of data is increasing. To
analyze and classify integrated HI spectral profiles in a efficient way, this
work presents a framework that integrates Machine Learning techniques,
combining unsupervised methods and CNNs. To this end, we apply our framework to
a selected subsample of 318 spectral HI profiles of the CIG and 30.780 profiles
from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA Survey catalogue. Data pre-processing
involved the Busyfit package and iterative fitting with polynomial, Gaussian,
and double-Lorentzian models. Clustering methods, including K-means, spectral
clustering, DBSCAN, and agglomerative clustering, were used for feature
extraction and to bootstrap classification we applied K-NN, SVM, and Random
Forest classifiers, optimizing accuracy with CNN. Additionally, we introduced a
2D model of the profiles to enhance classification by adding dimensionality to
the data. Three 2D models were generated based on transformations and
normalised versions to quantify the level of asymmetry. These methods were
tested in a previous analytical classification study conducted by the Analysis
of the Interstellar Medium in Isolated Galaxies group. This approach enhances
classification accuracy and aims to establish a methodology that could be
applied to data analysis in future surveys conducted with the Square Kilometre
Array (SKA), currently under construction. All materials, code, and models have
been made publicly available in an open-access repository, adhering to FAIR
principles.</p></br>
