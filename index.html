  Using An AI-based Survey of Exoplanet Atmospheres</h2></a>Authors:  Reza Ashtari, Kevin B. Stevenson, David Sing, Mercedes Lopez-Morales, Munazza K. Alam, Nikolay K. Nikolov, Thomas M. Evans-Soma</br>Comments: Accepted to AJ. 14 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Producing optimized and accurate transmission spectra of exoplanets from
telescope data has traditionally been a manual and labor-intensive procedure.
Here we present the results of the first attempt to improve and standardize
this procedure using artificial intelligence (AI) based processing of light
curves and spectroscopic data from transiting exoplanets observed with the
Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) instrument. We
implement an AI-based parameter optimizer that autonomously operates the Eureka
pipeline to produce homogeneous transmission spectra of publicly available HST
WFC3 datasets, spanning exoplanet types from hot Jupiters to sub-Neptunes.
Surveying 43 exoplanets with temperatures between 280 and 2580 Kelvin, we
confirm modeled relationships between the amplitude of the water band at 1.4um
in hot Jupiters and their equilibrium temperatures. We also identify a similar,
novel trend in Neptune/sub-Neptune atmospheres, but shifted to cooler
temperatures. Excitingly, a planet mass versus equilibrium temperature diagram
reveals a "Clear Sky Corridor," where planets between 700 and 1700 Kelvin
(depending on the mass) show stronger 1.4um H2O band measurements. This novel
trend points to metallicity as a potentially important driver of aerosol
formation. As we unveil and include these new discoveries into our
understanding of aerosol formation, we enter a thrilling future for the study
of exoplanet atmospheres. With HST sculpting this foundational understanding
for aerosol formation in various exoplanet types, ranging from Jupiters to
sub-Neptunes, we present a compelling platform for the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) to discover similar atmospheric trends for more planets across
a broader wavelength range.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06922v1"><h2>Estimating Exoplanet Mass using Machine Learning on Incomplete Datasets</h2></a>Authors:  Florian Lalande, Elizabeth Tasker, Kenji Doya</br>Comments: 30 pages, 14 figures, 1 table. Accepted for publication in the Open
  Journal of Astrophysics</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The exoplanet archive is an incredible resource of information on the
properties of discovered extrasolar planets, but statistical analysis has been
limited by the number of missing values. One of the most informative bulk
properties is planet mass, which is particularly challenging to measure with
more than 70\% of discovered planets with no measured value. We compare the
capabilities of five different machine learning algorithms that can utilize
multidimensional incomplete datasets to estimate missing properties for
imputing planet mass. The results are compared when using a partial subset of
the archive with a complete set of six planet properties, and where all planet
discoveries are leveraged in an incomplete set of six and eight planet
properties. We find that imputation results improve with more data even when
the additional data is incomplete, and allows a mass prediction for any planet
regardless of which properties are known. Our favored algorithm is the newly
developed $k$NN$\times$KDE, which can return a probability distribution for the
imputed properties. The shape of this distribution can indicate the algorithm's
level of confidence, and also inform on the underlying demographics of the
exoplanet population. We demonstrate how the distributions can be interpreted
with a series of examples for planets where the discovery was made with either
the transit method, or radial velocity method. Finally, we test the generative
capability of the $k$NN$\times$KDE to create a large synthetic population of
planets based on the archive, and identify potential categories of planets from
groups of properties in the multidimensional space. All codes are Open Source.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08923v1"><h2>Path-minimizing Latent ODEs for improved extrapolation and inference</h2></a>Authors:  Matt L. Sampson, Peter Melchior</br>Comments: 20 pages 11 figures</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM</br><p>Latent ODE models provide flexible descriptions of dynamic systems, but they
can struggle with extrapolation and predicting complicated non-linear dynamics.
The latent ODE approach implicitly relies on encoders to identify unknown
system parameters and initial conditions, whereas the evaluation times are
known and directly provided to the ODE solver. This dichotomy can be exploited
by encouraging time-independent latent representations. By replacing the common
variational penalty in latent space with an $\ell_2$ penalty on the path length
of each system, the models learn data representations that can easily be
distinguished from those of systems with different configurations. This results
in faster training, smaller models, more accurate interpolation and long-time
extrapolation compared to the baseline ODE models with GRU, RNN, and LSTM
encoder/decoders on tests with damped harmonic oscillator, self-gravitating
fluid, and predator-prey systems. We also demonstrate superior results for
simulation-based inference of the Lotka-Volterra parameters and initial
conditions by using the latents as data summaries for a conditional normalizing
flow. Our change to the training loss is agnostic to the specific recognition
network used by the decoder and can therefore easily be adopted by other latent
ODE models.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07548v1"><h2>Hybrid Summary Statistics</h2></a>Authors:  T. Lucas Makinen, Ce Sui, Benjamin D. Wandelt, Natalia Porqueres, Alan Heavens</br>Comments: 7 pages, 4 figures. Accepted to ML4PS2024 at NeurIPS 2024</br>Primary Category: stat.ML</br>All Categories: stat.ML, astro-ph.CO, cs.IT, cs.LG, math.IT, physics.data-an</br><p>We present a way to capture high-information posteriors from training sets
that are sparsely sampled over the parameter space for robust simulation-based
inference. In physical inference problems, we can often apply domain knowledge
to define traditional summary statistics to capture some of the information in
a dataset. We show that augmenting these statistics with neural network outputs
to maximise the mutual information improves information extraction compared to
neural summaries alone or their concatenation to existing summaries and makes
inference robust in settings with low training data. We introduce 1) two loss
formalisms to achieve this and 2) apply the technique to two different
cosmological datasets to extract non-Gaussian parameter information.</p></br>
