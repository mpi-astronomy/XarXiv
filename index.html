It focuses on two concepts of understanding: intuition and causality, and
highlights three AI technologies: Transformers, chain-of-thought reasoning, and
multimodal processing. We anticipate that in principle AI could form
understanding, with these technologies representing promising advancements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15739v1"><h2>Automatic Machine Learning Framework to Study Morphological Parameters
  of AGN Host Galaxies within $z < 1.4$ in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide Survey</h2></a>Authors:  Chuan Tian, C. Megan Urry, Aritra Ghosh, Daisuke Nagai, Tonima T. Ananna, Meredith C.

  Figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We present a composite machine learning framework to estimate posterior
probability distributions of bulge-to-total light ratio, half-light radius, and
flux for Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within $z<1.4$ and $m<23$
in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide survey. We divide the data into five redshift
bins: low ($0<z<0.25$), mid ($0.25<z<0.5$), high ($0.5<z<0.9$), extra
($0.9<z<1.1$) and extreme ($1.1<z<1.4$), and train our models independently in
each bin. We use PSFGAN to decompose the AGN point source light from its host
galaxy, and invoke the Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN)
to estimate morphological parameters of the recovered host galaxy. We first
trained our models on simulated data, and then fine-tuned our algorithm via
transfer learning using labeled real data. To create training labels for
transfer learning, we used GALFIT to fit $\sim 20,000$ real HSC galaxies in
each redshift bin. We comprehensively examined that the predicted values from
our final models agree well with the GALFIT values for the vast majority of
cases. Our PSFGAN + GaMPEN framework runs at least three orders of magnitude
faster than traditional light-profile fitting methods, and can be easily
retrained for other morphological parameters or on other datasets with diverse
ranges of resolutions, seeing conditions, and signal-to-noise ratios, making it
an ideal tool for analyzing AGN host galaxies from large surveys coming soon
from the Rubin-LSST, Euclid, and Roman telescopes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18423v1"><h2>DeepExtractor: Time-domain reconstruction of signals and glitches in
  gravitational wave data with deep learning</h2></a>Authors:  Tom Dooney, Harsh Narola, Stefano Bromuri, R. Lyana Curier, Chris Van Den Broeck, Sarah Caudill, Daniel Stanley Tan</br>Comments: 22 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.data-an, physics.ins-det</br><p>Gravitational wave (GW) interferometers, detect faint signals from distant
astrophysical events, such as binary black hole mergers. However, their high
sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure
these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called "glitches"
that can mimic astrophysical signals or mask their characteristics. Fast and
accurate reconstruction of both signals and glitches is crucial for reliable
scientific inference. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning
framework designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding
interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to
model the inherent noise distribution of GW interferometers, following
conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short
time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of
the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction. Our approach achieves
superior generalization capabilities for arbitrary signals and glitches
compared to methods that directly map inputs to the clean training waveforms.
We validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1)
reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2)
comparing performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3)
analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective
glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. DeepExtractor achieves a median
mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep
learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch
recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one
glitch sample in approx. 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's
processing time of approx. one hour per glitch.</p></br>
