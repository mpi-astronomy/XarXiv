  its application to the surface properties of dry lava planets</h2></a>Authors:  Charles Le Losq, Clément Ferraina, Paolo A. Sossi, Charles-Édouard Boukaré</br>Comments: 21 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG</br><p>Ultra-short-period exoplanets like K2-141 b likely have magma oceans on their
dayside, which play a critical role in redistributing heat within the planet.
This could lead to a warm nightside surface, measurable by the James Webb Space
Telescope, offering insights into the planet's structure. Accurate models of
properties like viscosity, which can vary by orders of magnitude, are essential
for such studies.
  We present a new model for predicting molten magma viscosity, applicable in
diverse scenarios, including magma oceans on lava planets. Using a database of
28,898 viscosity measurements on phospho-alumino-silicate melts, spanning
superliquidus to undercooled temperatures and pressures up to 30 GPa, we
trained a greybox artificial neural network, refined by a Gaussian process.
This model achieves high predictive accuracy (RMSE $\approx 0.4 \log_{10}$
Pa$\cdot$s) and can handle compositions from SiO$_2$ to multicomponent magmatic
and industrial glasses, accounting for pressure effects up to 30 GPa for
compositions such as peridotite.
  Applying this model, we calculated the viscosity of K2-141 b's magma ocean
under different compositions. Phase diagram calculations suggest that the
dayside is fully molten, with extreme temperatures primarily controlling
viscosity. A tenuous atmosphere (0.1 bar) might exist around a 40{\deg} radius
from the substellar point. At higher longitudes, atmospheric pressure drops,
and by 90{\deg}, magma viscosity rapidly increases as solidification occurs.
The nightside surface is likely solid, but previously estimated surface
temperatures above 400 K imply a partly molten mantle, feeding geothermal flux
through vertical convection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18761v1"><h2>Geometric deep learning for galaxy-halo connection: a case study for
  galaxy intrinsic alignments</h2></a>Authors:  Yesukhei Jagvaral, Francois Lanusse, Rachel Mandelbaum</br>Comments: 12 pages, 5 figures. submitted to MNRAS</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>Forthcoming cosmological imaging surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory LSST,
require large-scale simulations encompassing realistic galaxy populations for a
variety of scientific applications. Of particular concern is the phenomenon of
intrinsic alignments (IA), whereby galaxies orient themselves towards
overdensities, potentially introducing significant systematic biases in weak
gravitational lensing analyses if they are not properly modeled. Due to
computational constraints, simulating the intricate details of galaxy formation
and evolution relevant to IA across vast volumes is impractical. As an
alternative, we propose a Deep Generative Model trained on the IllustrisTNG-100
simulation to sample 3D galaxy shapes and orientations to accurately reproduce
intrinsic alignments along with correlated scalar features. We model the cosmic
web as a set of graphs, each graph representing a halo with nodes representing
the subhalos/galaxies. The architecture consists of a SO(3) $\times$
$\mathbb{R}^n$ diffusion generative model, for galaxy orientations and $n$
scalars, implemented with E(3) equivariant Graph Neural Networks that
explicitly respect the Euclidean symmetries of our Universe. The model is able
to learn and predict features such as galaxy orientations that are
statistically consistent with the reference simulation. Notably, our model
demonstrates the ability to jointly model Euclidean-valued scalars (galaxy
sizes, shapes, and colors) along with non-Euclidean valued SO(3) quantities
(galaxy orientations) that are governed by highly complex galactic physics at
non-linear scales.</p></br>
