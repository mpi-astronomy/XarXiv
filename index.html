  Heliophysics and Space Weather Prediction</h2></a>Authors:  Sujit Roy, Dinesha V. Hegde, Johannes Schmude, Amy Lin, Vishal Gaur, Rohit Lal, Kshitiz Mandal, Talwinder Singh, Andrés Muñoz-Jaramillo, Kang Yang, Chetraj Pandey, Jinsu Hong, Berkay Aydin, Ryan McGranaghan, Spiridon Kasapis, Vishal Upendran, Shah Bahauddin, Daniel da Silva, Marcus Freitag, Iksha Gurung, Nikolai Pogorelov, Campbell Watson, Manil Maskey, Juan Bernabe-Moreno, Rahul Ramachandran</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>This paper introduces a high resolution, machine learning-ready heliophysics
dataset derived from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), specifically
designed to advance machine learning (ML) applications in solar physics and
space weather forecasting. The dataset includes processed imagery from the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI),
spanning a solar cycle from May 2010 to July 2024. To ensure suitability for ML
tasks, the data has been preprocessed, including correction of spacecraft roll
angles, orbital adjustments, exposure normalization, and degradation
compensation. We also provide auxiliary application benchmark datasets
complementing the core SDO dataset. These provide benchmark applications for
central heliophysics and space weather tasks such as active region
segmentation, active region emergence forecasting, coronal field extrapolation,
solar flare prediction, solar EUV spectra prediction, and solar wind speed
estimation. By establishing a unified, standardized data collection, this
dataset aims to facilitate benchmarking, enhance reproducibility, and
accelerate the development of AI-driven models for critical space weather
prediction tasks, bridging gaps between solar physics, machine learning, and
operational forecasting.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14112v1"><h2>Surya: Foundation Model for Heliophysics</h2></a>Authors:  Sujit Roy, Johannes Schmude, Rohit Lal, Vishal Gaur, Marcus Freitag, Julian Kuehnert, Theodore van Kessel, Dinesha V.

and solar activity. Despite decades of high-resolution observations from the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), most models remain task-specific and
constrained by scarce labeled data, limiting their capacity to generalize
across solar phenomena. We introduce Surya, a 366M parameter foundation model
for heliophysics designed to learn general-purpose solar representations from
multi-instrument SDO observations, including eight Atmospheric Imaging Assembly
(AIA) channels and five Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) products. Surya
employs a spatiotemporal transformer architecture with spectral gating and
long--short range attention, pretrained on high-resolution solar image
forecasting tasks and further optimized through autoregressive rollout tuning.
Zero-shot evaluations demonstrate its ability to forecast solar dynamics and
flare events, while downstream fine-tuning with parameter-efficient Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) shows strong performance on solar wind forecasting, active
region segmentation, solar flare forecasting, and EUV spectra. Surya is the
first foundation model in heliophysics that uses time advancement as a pretext
task on full-resolution SDO data. Its novel architecture and performance
suggest that the model is able to learn the underlying physics behind solar
evolution.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11938v1"><h2>Wavelets for power spectral density estimation of gravitational wave
  data</h2></a>Authors:  Jin-Bao Zhu, Chao-Wan-Zhen Wang, Guo-Qing Huang, Fu-Wen Shu</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Power spectral density (PSD) estimation is a critical step in gravitational
wave (GW) detectors data analysis. The Welch method is a typical non-parametric
spectral estimation approach that estimates the PSD of stationary noise by
averaging periodograms of several time segments, or by taking the median of
periodograms to adapt to non-stationary noise. In this work, we propose a
wavelet-based approach for fast PSD estimation of both stationary and
non-stationary noise. For stationary noise, we apply wavelet smoothing to the
periodogram, avoiding the segmentation step in the Welch method, and enabling
PSD estimates with high frequency resolution and low variance. The wavelet
smoothing PSD outperforms Welch PSD in matched filtering and parameter
estimation. For non-stationary noise, we estimate the PSD by taking the median
of wavelet packet coefficients in each frequency bin, which offers greater
robustness than the traditional median periodogram method. This work introduces
a new PSD estimation approach for GW data analysis and expands the application
of wavelet methods in this field.</p></br>
