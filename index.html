scattering covariances, the most recent iteration of the scattering transforms
statistics. This model is designed to augment by several orders of magnitude
the number of map simulations in datasets of computationally expensive CMB
instrumental systematics simulations, including their non-Gaussian and
inhomogeneous features. Unlike conventional neural network-based algorithms,
this generative model requires only a minimal number of training samples,
making it highly compatible with the computational constraints of typical CMB
simulation campaigns. We validate the method using realistic simulations of CMB
systematics, which are particularly challenging to emulate, and perform
extensive statistical tests to confirm its ability to produce new statistically
independent approximate realizations. Remarkably, even when trained on as few
as 10 simulations, the emulator closely reproduces key summary statistics --
including the angular power spectrum, scattering coefficients, and Minkowski
functionals -- and provides pixel-to-pixel covariance estimates with
substantially reduced sample noise compared to those obtained without
augmentation. The proposed approach has the potential to shift the paradigm in
simulation campaign design. Instead of producing large numbers of low- or
medium-accuracy simulations, future pipelines can focus on generating a few
high-accuracy simulations that are then efficiently augmented using such
generative model. This promises significant benefits for current and
forthcoming cosmological surveys such as $Planck$, $LiteBIRD$, Simons
Observatory, CMB-S4, Euclid and Rubin-LSST. We make both the general framework
for scattering transform statistics available at
https://github.com/jmdelouis/HealpixML and the emulator available at

  Astroparticle Physics: Insights from JENA and EuCAIF</h2></a>Authors:  Sascha Caron, Andreas Ipp, Gert Aarts, Gábor Bíró, Daniele Bonacorsi, Elena Cuoco, Caterina Doglioni, Tommaso Dorigo, Julián García Pardiñas, Stefano Giagu, Tobias Golling, Lukas Heinrich, Ik Siong Heng, Paula Gina Isar, Karolos Potamianos, Liliana Teodorescu, John Veitch, Pietro Vischia, Christoph Weniger</br>Comments: 19 pages, 5 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.HE, cs.AI, cs.LG, hep-ex, hep-ph, nucl-th</br><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming scientific research, with deep
learning methods playing a central role in data analysis, simulations, and
signal detection across particle, nuclear, and astroparticle physics. Within
the JENA communities-ECFA, NuPECC, and APPEC-and as part of the EuCAIF
initiative, AI integration is advancing steadily. However, broader adoption
remains constrained by challenges such as limited computational resources, a
lack of expertise, and difficulties in transitioning from research and
development (R&D) to production. This white paper provides a strategic roadmap,
informed by a community survey, to address these barriers. It outlines critical
infrastructure requirements, prioritizes training initiatives, and proposes
funding strategies to scale AI capabilities across fundamental physics over the
next five years.</p></br>
