  imaging at high contrast</h2></a>Authors:  Théo Bodrito, Olivier Flasseur, Julien Mairal, Jean Ponce, Maud Langlois, Anne-Marie Lagrange</br>Comments: SF2A 2025</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>Exoplanet imaging is a major challenge in astrophysics due to the need for
high angular resolution and high contrast. We present a multi-scale statistical
model for the nuisance component corrupting multivariate image series at high
contrast. Integrated into a learnable architecture, it leverages the physics of
the problem and enables the fusion of multiple observations of the same star in
a way that is optimal in terms of detection signal-to-noise ratio. Applied to
data from the VLT/SPHERE instrument, the method significantly improves the
detection sensitivity and the accuracy of astrometric and photometric
estimation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20447v1"><h2>Neural Networks as Surrogate Solvers for Time-Dependent Accretion Disk
  Dynamics</h2></a>Authors:  Shunyuan Mao, Weiqi Wang, Sifan Wang, Ruobing Dong, Lu Lu, Kwang Moo Yi, Paris Perdikaris, Andrea Isella, Sébastien Fabbro, Lile Wang</br>Comments: Astrophysical Journal Letters accepted; associate animations are
  available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30192904</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Accretion disks are ubiquitous in astrophysics, appearing in diverse
environments from planet-forming systems to X-ray binaries and active galactic
nuclei. Traditionally, modeling their dynamics requires computationally
intensive (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations. Recently, Physics-Informed Neural
Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising alternative. This approach trains
neural networks directly on physical laws without requiring data. We for the
first time demonstrate PINNs for solving the two-dimensional, time-dependent
hydrodynamics of non-self-gravitating accretion disks. Our models provide
solutions at arbitrary times and locations within the training domain, and
successfully reproduce key physical phenomena, including the excitation and
propagation of spiral density waves and gap formation from disk-companion
interactions. Notably, the boundary-free approach enabled by PINNs naturally
eliminates the spurious wave reflections at disk edges, which are challenging
to suppress in numerical simulations. These results highlight how advanced
machine learning techniques can enable physics-driven, data-free modeling of
complex astrophysical systems, potentially offering an alternative to
traditional numerical simulations in the future.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21446v1"><h2>Forecasting Seismic Waveforms: A Deep Learning Approach for Einstein
  Telescope</h2></a>Authors:  Waleed Esmail, Alexander Kappes, Stuart Russell, Christine Thomas</br>Comments: 8 pages, 3 figures, ICRC 2025 Proceedings</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, gr-qc</br><p>We introduce \textit{SeismoGPT}, a transformer-based model for forecasting
three-component seismic waveforms in the context of future gravitational wave
detectors like the Einstein Telescope. The model is trained in an
autoregressive setting and can operate on both single-station and array-based
inputs. By learning temporal and spatial dependencies directly from waveform
data, SeismoGPT captures realistic ground motion patterns and provides accurate
short-term forecasts. Our results show that the model performs well within the
immediate prediction window and gradually degrades further ahead, as expected
in autoregressive systems. This approach lays the groundwork for data-driven
seismic forecasting that could support Newtonian noise mitigation and real-time
observatory control.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22018v1"><h2>Exploring the Early Universe with Deep Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Emmanuel de Salis, Massimo De Santis, Davide Piras, Sambit K. Giri, Michele Bianco, Nicolas Cerardi, Philipp Denzel, Merve Selcuk-Simsek, Kelley M. Hess, M. Carmen Toribio, Franz Kirsten, Hatem Ghorbel</br>Comments: EPIA 2025 preprint version, 12 pages, 3 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation
of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a
cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming
Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral
hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these
first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be
challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the
hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination
and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep
learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the
hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models
to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of
cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and
efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early
Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we
demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a
$0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This
enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of
structure formation in the early Universe.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21661v1"><h2>Automating Sensor Characterization with Bayesian Optimization</h2></a>Authors:  J. Cuevas-Zepeda, C. Chavez, J. Estrada, J. Noonan, B. D. Nord, N. Saffold, M. Sofo-Haro, R. Spinola e Castro, S. Trivedi</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: physics.ins-det</br>All Categories: physics.ins-det, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with
three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in
simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the
design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues
to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a
significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different
operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort
spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more
of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated
sensor calibration that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development
cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using
real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal
operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing
that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize
operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device
expert.</p></br>
