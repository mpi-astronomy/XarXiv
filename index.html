  Objects with Machine Learning</h2></a>Authors:  Bryce T. Bolin, Michael W. Coughlin</br>Comments: 25 pages, 9 figures, accepted chapter in Machine Learning for Small
  Bodies in the Solar System, Valerio Carruba, Evgeny Smirnov, and Dagmara
  Oszkiewicz, Elsevier, 2024, p. 209-227</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>In this chapter, we will discuss the use of Machine Learning methods for the
identification and localization of cometary activity for Solar System objects
in ground and in space-based wide-field all-sky surveys. We will begin the
chapter by discussing the challenges of identifying known and unknown active,
extended Solar System objects in the presence of stellar-type sources and the
application of classical pre-ML identification techniques and their
limitations. We will then transition to the discussion of implementing ML
techniques to address the challenge of extended object identification. We will
finish with prospective future methods and the application to future surveys
such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15263v1"><h2>The Palomar twilight survey of 'Ayló'chaxnim, Atiras, and comets</h2></a>Authors:  B. T. Bolin, F. J.

Swain</br>Comments: 26 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables, accepted for publication in Icarus</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>Near-sun sky twilight observations allow for the detection of asteroid
interior to the orbit of Venus (Aylos), the Earth (Atiras), and comets. We
present the results of observations with the Palomar 48-inch telescope
(P48)/Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) camera in 30 s r-band exposures taken
during evening astronomical twilight from 2019 Sep 20 to 2022 March 7 and
during morning astronomical twilight sky from 2019 Sep 21 to 2022 Sep 29. More
than 46,000 exposures were taken in evening and morning astronomical twilight
within 31 to 66 degrees from the Sun with an r-band limiting magnitude between
18.1 and 20.9. The twilight pointings show a slight seasonal dependence in
limiting magnitude and ability to point closer towards the Sun, with limiting
magnitude slightly improving during summer. In total, the one Aylo, (594913)
'Ayl\'o'chaxnim, and 4 Atiras, 2020 OV1, 2021 BS1, 2021 PB2, and 2021 VR3, were
discovered in evening and morning twilight observations. Additional twilight
survey discoveries also include 6 long-period comets: C/2020 T2, C/2020 V2,
C/2021 D2, C/2021 E3, C/2022 E3, and C/2022 P3, and two short-period comets:
P/2021 N1 and P/2022 P2 using deep learning comet detection pipelines. The
P48/ZTF twilight survey also recovered 11 known Atiras, one Aylo, three
short-period comes, two long-period comets, and one interstellar object.
Lastly, the Vera Rubin Observatory will conduct a twilight survey starting in
its first year of operations and will cover the sky within 45 degrees of the
Sun. Twilight surveys such as those by ZTF and future surveys will provide
opportunities for discovering asteroids inside the orbits of Earth and Venus.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14016v1"><h2>Enhancing Multivariate Time Series-based Solar Flare Prediction with
  Multifaceted Preprocessing and Contrastive Learning</h2></a>Authors:  MohammadReza EskandariNasab, Shah Muhammad Hamdi, Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi</br>Comments: This work has been accepted at ICMLA 2024 on September 7, 2024, as a
  regular paper for an oral presentation</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML</br><p>Accurate solar flare prediction is crucial due to the significant risks that
intense solar flares pose to astronauts, space equipment, and satellite
communication systems. Our research enhances solar flare prediction by
utilizing advanced data preprocessing and classification methods on a
multivariate time series-based dataset of photospheric magnetic field
parameters. First, our study employs a novel preprocessing pipeline that
includes missing value imputation, normalization, balanced sampling, near
decision boundary sample removal, and feature selection to significantly boost
prediction accuracy. Second, we integrate contrastive learning with a GRU
regression model to develop a novel classifier, termed ContReg, which employs
dual learning methodologies, thereby further enhancing prediction performance.
To validate the effectiveness of our preprocessing pipeline, we compare and
demonstrate the performance gain of each step, and to demonstrate the efficacy
of the ContReg classifier, we compare its performance to that of sequence-based
deep learning architectures, machine learning models, and findings from
previous studies. Our results illustrate exceptional True Skill Statistic (TSS)
scores, surpassing previous methods and highlighting the critical role of
precise data preprocessing and classifier development in time series-based
solar flare prediction.</p></br>
