  gravitational-wave astronomy</h2></a>Authors:  Michele Mancarella, Davide Gerosa</br>Comments: 9+1 pages, 4+1 figures</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>We present a full sampling of the hierarchical population posterior
distribution of merging black holes using current gravitational-wave data. We
directly tackle the the most relevant intrinsic parameter space made of the
binary parameters (masses, spin magnitudes, spin directions, redshift) of all
the events entering the GWTC-3 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA catalog, as well as the
hyperparameters of the underlying population of sources. This results in a
parameter space of about 500 dimensions, in contrast with current
investigations where the targeted dimensionality is drastically reduced by
marginalizing over all single-event parameters. In particular, we have direct
access to (i) population parameters, (ii) population-informed single-event
parameters, and (iii) correlations between these two sets of parameters. Our
implementation relies on modern probabilistic programming languages and
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, with a continuous interpolation of single-event
posterior probabilities. Sampling the full hierarchical problem is feasible, as
demonstrated here, and advantageous as it removes some (but not all) of the
Monte Carlo integrations that enter the likelihood together with the related
variances.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09790v1"><h2>ExoMiner++ on TESS with Transfer Learning from Kepler: Transit
  Classification and Vetting Catalog for 2-min Data</h2></a>Authors:  Hamed Valizadegan, Miguel J. S. Martinho, Jon M. Jenkins, Joseph D. Twicken, Douglas A.

Schwarz, Denise Stephens, Chris Stockdale, Jiaqi Wang, Cristilyn N. Watkins, Francis P. Wilkin</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the
success of ExoMiner to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS
data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including
periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft
attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing
transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further
enhance performance, we leverage transfer learning from high-quality labeled
data from the Kepler space telescope, mitigating the impact of TESS's noisier
and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various
classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space
for follow-up investigations to confirm new planets. To serve the exoplanet
community, we introduce new TESS catalogs containing ExoMiner++ classifications
and confidence scores for each transit signal. Among the 147,568 unlabeled
TCEs, ExoMiner++ identifies 7,330 as planet candidates, with the remainder
classified as false positives. These 7,330 planet candidates correspond to
1,868 existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), 69 Community TESS Objects of
Interest (CTOIs), and 50 newly introduced CTOIs. 1,797 out of the 2,506 TOIs
previously labeled as planet candidates in ExoFOP are classified as planet
candidates by ExoMiner++. This reduction in plausible candidates combined with
the excellent ranking quality of ExoMiner++ allows the follow-up efforts to be
focused on the most likely candidates, increasing the overall planet yield.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11823v1"><h2>SFTs: a scalable data-analysis framework for long-duration
  gravitational-wave signals</h2></a>Authors:  Rodrigo Tenorio, Davide Gerosa</br>Comments: 13 pages, 5 figures</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.HE, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>We introduce a framework based on Short-time Fourier Transforms (SFTs) to
analyze long-duration gravitational wave signals from compact binaries.
Targeted systems include binary neutron stars observed by third-generation
ground-based detectors and massive black-hole binaries observed by the LISA
space mission. In short, ours is an extremely fast, scalable, and
parallelizable implementation of the gravitational-wave inner product, a core
operation of gravitational-wave matched filtering. By operating on disjoint
data segments, SFTs allow for efficient handling of noise non-stationarities,
data gaps, and detector-induced signal modulations. We present a pilot
application to early warning problems in both ground- and space-based
next-generation detectors. Overall, SFTs reduce the computing cost of
evaluating an inner product by three to five orders of magnitude, depending on
the specific application, with respect to a standard approach. We release
public tools to operate using the SFT framework, including a vectorized and
hardware-accelerated re-implementation of a time-domain waveform. The inner
product is the key building block of all gravitational-wave data treatments; by
speeding up this low-level element so massively, SFTs provide an extremely
promising solution for current and future gravitational-wave data-analysis
problem</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.09810v1"><h2>$Î›$CDM and early dark energy in latent space: a data-driven
  parametrization of the CMB temperature power spectrum</h2></a>Authors:  Davide Piras, Laura Herold, Luisa Lucie-Smith, Eiichiro Komatsu</br>Comments: 17 pages, 12 figures, comments welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Finding the best parametrization for cosmological models in the absence of
first-principle theories is an open question. We propose a data-driven
parametrization of cosmological models given by the disentangled 'latent'
representation of a variational autoencoder (VAE) trained to compress cosmic
microwave background (CMB) temperature power spectra. We consider a broad range
of $\Lambda$CDM and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies with an additional early
dark energy (EDE) component. We show that these spectra can be compressed into
5 ($\Lambda$CDM) or 8 (EDE) independent latent parameters, as expected when
using temperature power spectra alone, and which reconstruct spectra at an
accuracy well within the Planck errors. These latent parameters have a physical
interpretation in terms of well-known features of the CMB temperature spectrum:
these include the position, height and even-odd modulation of the acoustic
peaks, as well as the gravitational lensing effect. The VAE also discovers one
latent parameter which entirely isolates the EDE effects from those related to
$\Lambda$CDM parameters, thus revealing a previously unknown degree of freedom
in the CMB temperature power spectrum. We further showcase how to place
constraints on the latent parameters using Planck data as typically done for
cosmological parameters, obtaining latent values consistent with previous
$\Lambda$CDM and EDE cosmological constraints. Our work demonstrates the
potential of a data-driven reformulation of current beyond-$\Lambda$CDM
phenomenological models into the independent degrees of freedom to which the
data observables are sensitive.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11134v1"><h2>Solving Online Resource-Constrained Scheduling for Follow-Up Observation
  in Astronomy: a Reinforcement Learning Approach</h2></a>Authors:  Yajie Zhang, Ce Yu, Chao Sun, Jizeng Wei, Junhan Ju, Shanjiang Tang</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.AI</br>All Categories: cs.AI, astro-ph.IM</br><p>In the astronomical observation field, determining the allocation of
observation resources of the telescope array and planning follow-up
observations for targets of opportunity (ToOs) are indispensable components of
astronomical scientific discovery. This problem is computationally challenging,
given the online observation setting and the abundance of time-varying factors
that can affect whether an observation can be conducted. This paper presents
ROARS, a reinforcement learning approach for online astronomical
resource-constrained scheduling. To capture the structure of the astronomical
observation scheduling, we depict every schedule using a directed acyclic graph
(DAG), illustrating the dependency of timing between different observation
tasks within the schedule. Deep reinforcement learning is used to learn a
policy that can improve the feasible solution by iteratively local rewriting
until convergence. It can solve the challenge of obtaining a complete solution
directly from scratch in astronomical observation scenarios, due to the high
computational complexity resulting from numerous spatial and temporal
constraints. A simulation environment is developed based on real-world
scenarios for experiments, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
scheduling approach. The experimental results show that ROARS surpasses 5
popular heuristics, adapts to various observation scenarios and learns
effective strategies with hindsight.</p></br>
