  Gaussian Process Regression?</h2></a>Authors:  Purba Mukherjee, Antara Dey, Supratik Pal</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Reionization is one of the least understood processes in the evolution
history of the Universe, mostly because of the numerous astrophysical processes
occurring simultaneously about which we do not have a very clear idea so far.
In this article, we use the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method to learn
the reionization history and infer the astrophysical parameters. We reconstruct
the UV luminosity density function using the HFF and early JWST data. From the
reconstructed history of reionization, the global differential brightness
temperature fluctuation during this epoch has been computed. We perform MCMC
analysis of the global 21-cm signal using the instrumental specifications of
SARAS, in combination with Lyman-$\alpha$ ionization fraction data, Planck
optical depth measurements and UV luminosity data. Our analysis reveals that
GPR can help infer the astrophysical parameters in a model-agnostic way than
conventional methods. Additionally, we analyze the 21-cm power spectrum using
the reconstructed history of reionization and demonstrate how the future 21-cm
mission SKA, in combination with Planck and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data,
improves the bounds on the reionization astrophysical parameters by doing a
joint MCMC analysis for the astrophysical parameters plus 6 cosmological
parameters for $\Lambda$CDM model. The results make the GPR-based
reconstruction technique a robust learning process and the inferences on the
astrophysical parameters obtained therefrom are quite reliable that can be used
for future analysis.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20432v1"><h2>Neural Surrogate HMC: Accelerated Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with a Neural
  Network Surrogate Likelihood</h2></a>Authors:  Linnea M Wolniewicz, Peter Sadowski, Claudio Corti</br>Comments: 5 pages, 3 figures, accepted at SPAICE Conference 2024</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.HE, I.2.1</br><p>Bayesian Inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo requires efficient
computation of the likelihood function. In some scientific applications, the
likelihood must be computed by numerically solving a partial differential
equation, which can be prohibitively expensive. We demonstrate that some such
problems can be made tractable by amortizing the computation with a surrogate
likelihood function implemented by a neural network. We show that this has two
additional benefits: reducing noise in the likelihood evaluations and providing
fast gradient calculations. In experiments, the approach is applied to a model
of heliospheric transport of galactic cosmic rays, where it enables efficient
sampling from the posterior of latent parameters in the Parker equation.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21008v1"><h2>Bayesian technique to combine independently-trained Machine-Learning
  models applied to direct dark matter detection</h2></a>Authors:  David Cerdeno, Martin de los Rios, Andres D. Perez</br>Comments: 25 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</br>Primary Category: hep-ph</br>All Categories: hep-ph, astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an</br><p>We carry out a Bayesian analysis of dark matter (DM) direct detection data to
determine particle model parameters using the Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio
Estimation (TMNRE) machine learning technique. TMNRE avoids an explicit
calculation of the likelihood, which instead is estimated from simulated data,
unlike in traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This
considerably speeds up, by several orders of magnitude, the computation of the
posterior distributions, which allows to perform the Bayesian analysis of an
otherwise computationally prohibitive number of benchmark points. In this
article we demonstrate that, in the TMNRE framework, it is possible to include,
combine, and remove different datasets in a modular fashion, which is fast and
simple as there is no need to re-train the machine learning algorithm or to
define a combined likelihood. In order to assess the performance of this
method, we consider the case of WIMP DM with spin-dependent and independent
interactions with protons and neutrons in a xenon experiment. After validating
our results with MCMC, we employ the TMNRE procedure to determine the regions
where the DM parameters can be reconstructed. Finally, we present CADDENA, a
Python package that implements the modular Bayesian analysis of direct
detection experiments described in this work.</p></br>
