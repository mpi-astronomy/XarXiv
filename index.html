  data</h2></a>Authors:  Jin-Bao Zhu, Chao-Wan-Zhen Wang, Guo-Qing Huang, Fu-Wen Shu</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: gr-qc</br>All Categories: gr-qc, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Power spectral density (PSD) estimation is a critical step in gravitational
wave (GW) detectors data analysis. The Welch method is a typical non-parametric
spectral estimation approach that estimates the PSD of stationary noise by
averaging periodograms of several time segments, or by taking the median of
periodograms to adapt to non-stationary noise. In this work, we propose a
wavelet-based approach for fast PSD estimation of both stationary and
non-stationary noise. For stationary noise, we apply wavelet smoothing to the
periodogram, avoiding the segmentation step in the Welch method, and enabling
PSD estimates with high frequency resolution and low variance. The wavelet
smoothing PSD outperforms Welch PSD in matched filtering and parameter
estimation. For non-stationary noise, we estimate the PSD by taking the median
of wavelet packet coefficients in each frequency bin, which offers greater
robustness than the traditional median periodogram method. This work introduces
a new PSD estimation approach for GW data analysis and expands the application
of wavelet methods in this field.</p></br>
