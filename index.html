  applications to modelling water activity of comets</h2></a>Authors:  Shunjing Zhao, Xian Shi, Hanlun Lei</br>Comments: accepted for publication in A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Cometary activity is a compelling subject of study, with thermophysical
models playing a pivotal role in its understanding. However, traditional
numerical solutions for small body thermophysical models are computationally
intensive, posing challenges for investigations requiring high-resolution or
repetitive modeling. To address this limitation, we employed a machine learning
approach to develop ThermoONet - a neural network designed to predict the
temperature and water ice sublimation flux of comets. Performance evaluations
indicate that ThermoONet achieves a low average error in subsurface temperature
of approximately 2% relative to the numerical simulation, while reducing
computational time by nearly six orders of magnitude. We applied ThermoONet to
model the water activity of comets 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and
21P/Giacobini-Zinner. By successfully fitting the water production rate curves
of these comets, as obtained by the Rosetta mission and the SOHO telescope,
respectively, we demonstrate the network's effectiveness and efficiency.
Furthermore, when combined with a global optimization algorithm, ThermoONet
proves capable of retrieving the physical properties of target bodies.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16041v1"><h2>Physics-based machine learning for mantle convection simulations</h2></a>Authors:  Siddhant Agarwal, Ali Can Bekar, Christian Hüttig, David S. Greenberg, Nicola Tosi</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>Mantle convection simulations are an essential tool for understanding how
rocky planets evolve. However, the poorly known input parameters to these
simulations, the non-linear dependence of transport properties on pressure and
temperature, and the long integration times in excess of several billion years
all pose a computational challenge for numerical solvers. We propose a
physics-based machine learning approach that predicts creeping flow velocities
as a function of temperature while conserving mass, thereby bypassing the
numerical solution of the Stokes problem. A finite-volume solver then uses the
predicted velocities to advect and diffuse the temperature field to the next
time-step, enabling autoregressive rollout at inference. For training, our
model requires temperature-velocity snapshots from a handful of simulations
(94). We consider mantle convection in a two-dimensional rectangular box with
basal and internal heating, pressure- and temperature-dependent viscosity.
Overall, our model is up to 89 times faster than the numerical solver. We also
show the importance of different components in our convolutional neural network
architecture such as mass conservation, learned paddings on the boundaries, and
loss scaling for the overall rollout performance. Finally, we test our approach
on unseen scenarios to demonstrate some of its strengths and weaknesses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16320v1"><h2>Learning novel representations of variable sources from multi-modal
  $\textit{Gaia}$ data via autoencoders</h2></a>Authors:  P. Huijse, J. De Ridder, L. Eyer, L. Rimoldini, B. Holl, N. Chornay, J. Roquette, K. Nienartowicz, G. Jevardat de Fombelle, D. J.

BP/RP (XP) low-resolution mean spectra, and supervised classification results
for millions of variable sources. This extensive dataset offers a unique
opportunity to study their variability by combining multiple Gaia data
products. In preparation for DR4, we propose and evaluate a machine learning
methodology capable of ingesting multiple Gaia data products to achieve an
unsupervised classification of stellar and quasar variability. A dataset of 4
million Gaia DR3 sources is used to train three variational autoencoders (VAE),
which are artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed for data compression and
generation. One VAE is trained on Gaia XP low-resolution spectra, another on a
novel approach based on the distribution of magnitude differences in the Gaia G
band, and the third on folded Gaia G band light curves. Each Gaia source is
compressed into 15 numbers, representing the coordinates in a 15-dimensional
latent space generated by combining the outputs of these three models. The
learned latent representation produced by the ANN effectively distinguishes
between the main variability classes present in Gaia DR3, as demonstrated
through both supervised and unsupervised classification analysis of the latent
space. The results highlight a strong synergy between light curves and
low-resolution spectral data, emphasising the benefits of combining the
different Gaia data products. A two-dimensional projection of the latent
variables reveals numerous overdensities, most of which strongly correlate with
astrophysical properties, showing the potential of this latent space for
astrophysical discovery. We show that the properties of our novel latent
representation make it highly valuable for variability analysis tasks,
including classification, clustering and outlier detection.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14877v1"><h2>A self-regulated convolutional neural network for classifying variable
  stars</h2></a>Authors:  Francisco Pérez-Galarce, Jorge Martínez-Palomera, Karim Pichara, Pablo Huijse, Márcio Catelan</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.SR</br><p>Over the last two decades, machine learning models have been widely applied
and have proven effective in classifying variable stars, particularly with the
adoption of deep learning architectures such as convolutional neural networks,
recurrent neural networks, and transformer models. While these models have
achieved high accuracy, they require high-quality, representative data and a
large number of labelled samples for each star type to generalise well, which
can be challenging in time-domain surveys. This challenge often leads to models
learning and reinforcing biases inherent in the training data, an issue that is
not easily detectable when validation is performed on subsamples from the same
catalogue. The problem of biases in variable star data has been largely
overlooked, and a definitive solution has yet to be established. In this paper,
we propose a new approach to improve the reliability of classifiers in variable
star classification by introducing a self-regulated training process. This
process utilises synthetic samples generated by a physics-enhanced latent space
variational autoencoder, incorporating six physical parameters from Gaia Data
Release 3. Our method features a dynamic interaction between a classifier and a
generative model, where the generative model produces ad-hoc synthetic light
curves to reduce confusion during classifier training and populate
underrepresented regions in the physical parameter space. Experiments conducted
under various scenarios demonstrate that our self-regulated training approach
outperforms traditional training methods for classifying variable stars on
biased datasets, showing statistically significant improvements.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14754v1"><h2>Model-Independent Machine Learning Approach for Nanometric Axial
  Localization and Tracking</h2></a>Authors:  Andrey Alexandrov, Giovanni Acampora, Giovanni De Lellis, Antonia Di Crescenzo, Chiara Errico, Daria Morozova, Valeri Tioukov, Autilia Vittiello</br>Comments: 11 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</br>Primary Category: eess.IV</br>All Categories: eess.IV, astro-ph.IM, cs.CV, cs.LG, physics.ins-det</br><p>Accurately tracking particles and determining their position along the
optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when
extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning
approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial
positions from dual-focal plane images without relying on predefined models.
Our method achieves an axial localization accuracy of 40 nanometers - six times
better than traditional single-focal plane techniques. The model's simple
design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses,
including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation
protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging,
materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how
machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise
information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific
applications.</p></br>
