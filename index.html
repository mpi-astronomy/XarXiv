Azari, Joey Pasterski, Luoth Chou, Melissa Trainer, Ryan Danell, Desmond Kaplan, Xiang Li, Lily Clough, Brett McKinney, Lukas Mandrake, Bill Diamond, Caroline Freissinet</br>Comments: 8 pages (expanded citations compared to 5 page submitted version for
  DARES white papers), a white paper for the 2025 NASA Decadal Astrobiology
  Research and Exploration Strategy (DARES)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.AI, cs.LG</br><p>In recent decades, artificial intelligence (AI) including machine learning
(ML) have become vital for space missions enabling rapid data processing,
advanced pattern recognition, and enhanced insight extraction. These tools are
especially valuable in astrobiology applications, where models must distinguish
biotic patterns from complex abiotic backgrounds. Advancing the integration of
autonomy through AI and ML into space missions is a complex challenge, and we
believe that by focusing on key areas, we can make significant progress and
offer practical recommendations for tackling these obstacles.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01835v1"><h2>Autonomous optical navigation for DESTINY+: Enhancing misalignment
  robustness in flyby observations with a rotating telescope</h2></a>Authors:  Takayuki Hosonuma, Takeshi Miyabara, Naoya Ozaki, Ko Ishibashi, Yuta Suzaki, Peng Hong, Masayuki Ohta, Takeshi Takashima</br>Comments: 19 pages, 25 figures, submitted to Acta Astronautica</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.LG</br><p>DESTINY+ is an upcoming JAXA Epsilon medium-class mission to flyby multiple
asteroids including Phaethon. As an asteroid flyby observation instrument, a
telescope mechanically capable of single-axis rotation, named TCAP, is mounted
on the spacecraft to track and observe the target asteroids during flyby. As in
past flyby missions utilizing rotating telescopes, TCAP is also used as a
navigation camera for autonomous optical navigation during the closest-approach
phase. To mitigate the degradation of the navigation accuracy, past missions
performed calibration of the navigation camera's alignment before starting
optical navigation. However, such calibration requires significant operational
time to complete and imposes constraints on the operation sequence. From the
above background, the DESTINY+ team has studied the possibility of reducing
operational costs by allowing TCAP alignment errors to remain. This paper
describes an autonomous optical navigation algorithm robust to the misalignment
of rotating telescopes, proposed in this context. In the proposed method, the
misalignment of the telescope is estimated simultaneously with the spacecraft's
orbit relative to the flyby target. To deal with the nonlinearity between the
misalignment and the observation value, the proposed method utilizes the
unscented Kalman filter, instead of the extended Kalman filter widely used in
past studies. The proposed method was evaluated with numerical simulations on a
PC and with hardware-in-the-loop simulation, taking the Phaethon flyby in the
DESTINY+ mission as an example. The validation results suggest that the
proposed method can mitigate the misalignment-induced degradation of the
optical navigation accuracy with reasonable computational costs suited for
onboard computers.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24271v1"><h2>Enhancing Image Resolution of Solar Magnetograms: A Latent Diffusion
  Model Approach</h2></a>Authors:  Francesco Pio Ramunno, Paolo Massa, Vitaliy Kinakh, Brandon Panos, Andr√© Csillaghy, Slava Voloshynovskiy</br>Comments: Accepted for publication on A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>The spatial properties of the solar magnetic field are crucial to decoding
the physical processes in the solar interior and their interplanetary effects.
However, observations from older instruments, such as the Michelson Doppler
Imager (MDI), have limited spatial or temporal resolution, which hinders the
ability to study small-scale solar features in detail. Super resolving these
older datasets is essential for uniform analysis across different solar cycles,
enabling better characterization of solar flares, active regions, and magnetic
network dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel diffusion model approach
for Super-Resolution and we apply it to MDI magnetograms to match the
higher-resolution capabilities of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI).
By training a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) with residuals on downscaled HMI
data and fine-tuning it with paired MDI/HMI data, we can enhance the resolution
of MDI observations from 2"/pixel to 0.5"/pixel. We evaluate the quality of the
reconstructed images by means of classical metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM, FID and
LPIPS) and we check if physical properties, such as the unsigned magnetic flux
or the size of an active region, are preserved. We compare our model with
different variations of LDM and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models
(DDPMs), but also with two deterministic architectures already used in the past
for performing the Super-Resolution task. Furthermore, we show with an analysis
in the Fourier domain that the LDM with residuals can resolve features smaller
than 2", and due to the probabilistic nature of the LDM, we can asses their
reliability, in contrast with the deterministic models. Future studies aim to
super-resolve the temporal scale of the solar MDI instrument so that we can
also have a better overview of the dynamics of the old events.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01092v1"><h2>Initial Conditions from Galaxies: Machine-Learning Subgrid Correction to
  Standard Reconstruction</h2></a>Authors:  Liam Parker, Adrian E. Bayer, Uros Seljak</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.data-an</br><p>We present a hybrid method for reconstructing the primordial density from
late-time halos and galaxies. Our approach involves two steps: (1) apply
standard Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) reconstruction to recover the
large-scale features in the primordial density field and (2) train a deep
learning model to learn small-scale corrections on partitioned subgrids of the
full volume. At inference, this correction is then convolved across the full
survey volume, enabling scaling to large survey volumes. We train our method on
both mock halo catalogs and mock galaxy catalogs in both configuration and
redshift space from the Quijote $1(h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ simulation suite.
When evaluated on held-out simulations, our combined approach significantly
improves the reconstruction cross-correlation coefficient with the true initial
density field and remains robust to moderate model misspecification.
Additionally, we show that models trained on $1(h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ can be
applied to larger boxes--e.g., $(3h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$--without retraining.
Finally, we perform a Fisher analysis on our method's recovery of the BAO peak,
and find that it significantly improves the error on the acoustic scale
relative to standard BAO reconstruction. Ultimately, this method robustly
captures nonlinearities and bias without sacrificing large-scale accuracy, and
its flexibility to handle arbitrarily large volumes without escalating
computational requirements makes it especially promising for large-volume
surveys like DESI.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01660v1"><h2>STRAUSS: Sonification Tools & Resources for Analysis Using Sound
  Synthesis</h2></a>Authors:  James W. Trayford, Samantha Youles, Chris Harrison, Rose Shepherd, Nicolas Bonne</br>Comments: 4 pages, linking to documentation on ReadTheDocs
  (https://strauss.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Sonification, or conveying data using non-verbal audio, is a relatively niche
but growing approach for presenting data across multiple specialist domains
including astronomy, climate science, and beyond. The STRAUSS Python package
aims to provide such a tool, which builds upon previous approaches to provide a
powerful means to explore different ways of expressing data, with fine control
over the output audio and its format. STRAUSS is a free, open source (FOSS)
package, designed to allow flexible and effective sonification to be integrated
into data workflows, in analogy to widely used visualisation packages. The
remit of STRAUSS is broad; it is intended to be able to bridge between ad-hoc
solutions for sonifying very particular datasets, and highly technical
compositional and sound-design tools that are not optimised for sonification,
or may have a steep learning curve. The code offers a range of approaches to
sonification for a variety of contexts (e.g. science education, science
communication, technical data analysis, etc). To this end, STRAUSS is packaged
with a number of examples of different sonification approaches, and preset
configurations to support "low-barrier, high-ceiling" approach. STRAUSS has
been used to produce both educational resources and analysis tools.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02196v1"><h2>Orbit Determination through Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</h2></a>Authors:  Pedro K de Albuquerque, Andre R Kuroswiski, Annie S. Wu, Willer G. dos Santos, Paulo Costa</br>Comments: This paper was presented at the 2024 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics
  Specialist Conference, August 11-15, 2024, Broomfield, Colorado, USA</br>Primary Category: physics.ins-det</br>All Categories: physics.ins-det, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>This research explores the use of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation
as a reference signal for Initial Orbit Determination (IOD). By leveraging the
unique properties of CMB, this study introduces a novel method for estimating
spacecraft velocity and position with minimal reliance on pre-existing
environmental data, offering significant advantages for space missions
independent of Earth-specific conditions. Using Machine Learning (ML)
regression models, this approach demonstrates the capability to determine
velocity from CMB signals and subsequently determine the satellite's position.
The results indicate that CMB has the potential to enhance the autonomy and
flexibility of spacecraft operations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00347v1"><h2>Using machine learning method for variable star classification using the
  TESS Sectors 1-57 data</h2></a>Authors:  Li-Heng Wang, Kai Li, Xiang Gao, Ya-Ni Guo, Guo-You Sun</br>Comments: 15pages, 12 figures, 3 tables, accepted by ApJ, Data available via
  China-VO PaperData repository</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a wide-field all-sky
survey mission designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets. After over four years
photometric surveys, data from sectors 1-57, including approximately 1,050,000
light curves with a 2-minute cadence, were collected. By cross-matching the
data with Gaia's variable star catalogue, we obtained labeled datasets for
further analysis. Using a random forest classifier, we performed classification
of variable stars and designed distinct classification processes for each
subclass, 6770 EA, 2971 EW, 980 CEP, 8347 DSCT, 457 RRab, 404 RRc and 12348 ROT
were identified. Each variable star was visually inspected to ensure the
reliability and accuracy of the compiled catalog. Subsequently, we ultimately
obtained 6046 EA, 3859 EW, 2058 CEP, 8434 DSCT, 482 RRab, 416 RRc, and 9694
ROT, and a total of 14092 new variable stars were discovered.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23686v1"><h2>Data-Driven Forecasting of High-Dimensional Transient and Stationary
  Processes via Space-Time Projection</h2></a>Authors:  Oliver T. Schmidt</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.GA, nlin.CD, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an, physics.flu-dyn</br><p>Space-Time Projection (STP) is introduced as a data-driven forecasting
approach for high-dimensional and time-resolved data. The method computes
extended space-time proper orthogonal modes from training data spanning a
prediction horizon comprising both hindcast and forecast intervals. Forecasts
are then generated by projecting the hindcast portion of these modes onto new
data, simultaneously leveraging their orthogonality and optimal correlation
with the forecast extension. Rooted in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)
theory, dimensionality reduction and time-delay embedding are intrinsic to the
approach. For a given ensemble and fixed prediction horizon, the only tunable
parameter is the truncation rank--no additional hyperparameters are required.
The hindcast accuracy serves as a reliable indicator for short-term forecast
accuracy and establishes a lower bound on forecast errors. The efficacy of the
method is demonstrated using two datasets: transient, highly anisotropic
simulations of supernova explosions in a turbulent interstellar medium, and
experimental velocity fields of a turbulent high-subsonic engineering flow. In
a comparative study with standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
networks--acknowledging that alternative architectures or training strategies
may yield different outcomes--the method consistently provided more accurate
forecasts. Considering its simplicity and robust performance, STP offers an
interpretable and competitive benchmark for forecasting high-dimensional
transient and chaotic processes, relying purely on spatiotemporal correlation
information.</p></br>
