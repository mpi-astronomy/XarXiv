for spacecraft navigation, orbit determination, and spacecraft systems
management. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging neural implicit
representations to model eclipse conditions efficiently and reliably. We
propose neural network architectures that capture the complex silhouettes of
asteroids and comets with high precision. Tested on four well-characterized
bodies - Bennu, Itokawa, 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, and Eros - our method
achieves accuracy comparable to traditional ray-tracing techniques while
offering orders of magnitude faster performance. Additionally, we develop an
indirect learning framework that trains these models directly from sparse
trajectory data using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations, removing the
requirement to have prior knowledge of an accurate shape model. This approach
allows for the continuous refinement of eclipse predictions, progressively
reducing errors and improving accuracy as new trajectory data is incorporated.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07235v1"><h2>Earth-like planet predictor: A machine learning approach</h2></a>Authors:  Jeanne Davoult, Romain Eltschinger, Yann Alibert</br>Comments: 11 pages, 5 figures, published in A&A</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Searching for planets analogous to Earth in terms of mass and equilibrium
temperature is currently the first step in the quest for habitable conditions
outside our Solar System and, ultimately, the search for life in the universe.
Future missions such as PLATO or LIFE will begin to detect and characterise
these small, cold planets, dedicating significant observation time to them. The
aim of this work is to predict which stars are most likely to host an
Earth-like planet (ELP) to avoid blind searches, minimises detection times, and
thus maximises the number of detections. Using a previous study on correlations
between the presence of an ELP and the properties of its system, we trained a
Random Forest to recognise and classify systems as 'hosting an ELP' or 'not
hosting an ELP'. The Random Forest was trained and tested on populations of
synthetic planetary systems derived from the Bern model, and then applied to
real observed systems. The tests conducted on the machine learning (ML) model
yield precision scores of up to 0.99, indicating that 99% of the systems
identified by the model as having ELPs possess at least one. Among the few real
observed systems that have been tested, 44 have been selected as having a high
probability of hosting an ELP, and a quick study of the stability of these
systems confirms that the presence of an Earth-like planet within them would
leave them stable. The excellent results obtained from the tests conducted on
the ML model demonstrate its ability to recognise the typical architectures of
systems with or without ELPs within populations derived from the Bern model. If
we assume that the Bern model adequately describes the architecture of real
systems, then such a tool can prove indispensable in the search for Earth-like
planets. A similar approach could be applied to other planetary system
formation models to validate those predictions.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05962v1"><h2>Autoencoder-Based Detection of Anomalous Stokes V Spectra in the
  Flare-Producing Active Region 13663 Using Hinode/SP Observations</h2></a>Authors:  Jargalmaa Batmunkh, Yusuke Iida, Takayoshi Oba</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.SR</br><p>Detecting unusual signals in observational solar spectra is crucial for
understanding the features associated with impactful solar events, such as
solar flares. However, existing spectral analysis techniques face challenges,
particularly when relying on pre-defined, physics-based calculations to process
large volumes of noisy and complex observational data. To address these
limitations, we applied deep learning to detect anomalies in the Stokes V
spectra from the Hinode/SP instrument. Specifically, we developed an
autoencoder model for spectral compression, which serves as an anomaly
detection method. Our model effectively identifies anomalous spectra within
spectro-polarimetric maps captured prior to the onset of the X1.3 flare on May
5, 2024, in NOAA AR 13663. These atypical spectral points exhibit highly
complex profiles and spatially align with polarity inversion lines in
magnetogram images, indicating their potential as sites of magnetic energy
storage and possible triggers for flares. Notably, the detected anomalies are
highly localized, making them particularly challenging to identify in
magnetogram images using current manual methods.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07777v1"><h2>Adaptive Detection of Fast Moving Celestial Objects Using a Mixture of
  Experts and Physical-Inspired Neural Network</h2></a>Authors:  Peng Jia, Ge Li, Bafeng Cheng, Yushan Li, Rongyu Sun</br>Comments: Accepted by the AJ</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.EP, cs.CV, cs.LG, physics.optics</br><p>Fast moving celestial objects are characterized by velocities across the
celestial sphere that significantly differ from the motions of background
stars. In observational images, these objects exhibit distinct shapes,
contrasting with the typical appearances of stars. Depending on the
observational method employed, these celestial entities may be designated as
near-Earth objects or asteroids. Historically, fast moving celestial objects
have been observed using ground-based telescopes, where the relative stability
of stars and Earth facilitated effective image differencing techniques
alongside traditional fast moving celestial object detection and classification
algorithms. However, the growing prevalence of space-based telescopes, along
with their diverse observational modes, produces images with different
properties, rendering conventional methods less effective. This paper presents
a novel algorithm for detecting fast moving celestial objects within star
fields. Our approach enhances state-of-the-art fast moving celestial object
detection neural networks by transforming them into physical-inspired neural
networks. These neural networks leverage the point spread function of the
telescope and the specific observational mode as prior information; they can
directly identify moving fast moving celestial objects within star fields
without requiring additional training, thereby addressing the limitations of
traditional techniques. Additionally, all neural networks are integrated using
the mixture of experts technique, forming a comprehensive fast moving celestial
object detection algorithm. We have evaluated our algorithm using simulated
observational data that mimics various observations carried out by space based
telescope scenarios and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our
method effectively detects fast moving celestial objects across different
observational modes.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05235v1"><h2>IAEmu: Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations</h2></a>Authors:  Sneh Pandya, Yuanyuan Yang, Nicholas Van Alfen, Jonathan Blazek, Robin Walters</br>Comments: 16 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing
analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions
and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust
cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods
that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce
IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy
position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and
orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties
using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework.
Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for
$\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The
emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify
regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate
generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG
hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu
enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation
functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration
facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a
powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct
applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</p></br>
