  Discovery from Simulations</h2></a>Authors:  Kai L. Polsterer, Bernd Doser, Andreas Fehlner, Sebastian Trujillo-Gomez</br>Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Simulations are the best approximation to experimental laboratories in
astrophysics and cosmology. However, the complexity, richness, and large size
of their outputs severely limit the interpretability of their predictions. We
describe a new, unbiased, and machine learning based approach to obtaining
useful scientific insights from a broad range of simulations. The method can be
used on today's largest simulations and will be essential to solve the extreme
data exploration and analysis challenges posed by the Exascale era.
Furthermore, this concept is so flexible, that it will also enable explorative
access to observed data. Our concept is based on applying nonlinear
dimensionality reduction to learn compact representations of the data in a
low-dimensional space. The simulation data is projected onto this space for
interactive inspection, visual interpretation, sample selection, and local
analysis. We present a prototype using a rotational invariant hyperspherical
variational convolutional autoencoder, utilizing a power distribution in the
latent space, and trained on galaxies from IllustrisTNG simulation. Thereby, we
obtain a natural Hubble tuning fork like similarity space that can be
visualized interactively on the surface of a sphere by exploiting the power of
HiPS tilings in Aladin Lite.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02785v1"><h2>Event-horizon-scale Imaging of M87* under Different Assumptions via Deep
  Generative Image Priors</h2></a>Authors:  Berthy T. Feng, Katherine L. Bouman, William T. Freeman</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, eess.IV</br><p>Reconstructing images from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of
M87*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy M87, depends on a
prior to impose desired image statistics. However, given the impossibility of
directly observing black holes, there is no clear choice for a prior. We
present a framework for flexibly designing a range of priors, each bringing
different biases to the image reconstruction. These priors can be weak (e.g.,
impose only basic natural-image statistics) or strong (e.g., impose assumptions
of black-hole structure). Our framework uses Bayesian inference with
score-based priors, which are data-driven priors arising from a deep generative
model that can learn complicated image distributions. Using our Bayesian
imaging approach with sophisticated data-driven priors, we can assess how
visual features and uncertainty of reconstructed images change depending on the
prior. In addition to simulated data, we image the real EHT M87* data and
discuss how recovered features are influenced by the choice of prior.</p></br>
