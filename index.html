  in PHOEBE Forward Models</h2></a>Authors:  Marcin Wrona, Andrej Prša</br>Comments: Submitted to AAS Journals. 26 pages, 21 figures, 3 tables</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.GA, cs.LG</br><p>In modern astronomy, the quantity of data collected has vastly exceeded the
capacity for manual analysis, necessitating the use of advanced artificial
intelligence (AI) techniques to assist scientists with the most labor-intensive
tasks. AI can optimize simulation codes where computational bottlenecks arise
from the time required to generate forward models. One such example is PHOEBE,
a modeling code for eclipsing binaries (EBs), where simulating individual
systems is feasible, but analyzing observables for extensive parameter
combinations is highly time-consuming.
  To address this, we present a fully connected feedforward artificial neural
network (ANN) trained on a dataset of over one million synthetic light curves
generated with PHOEBE. Optimization of the ANN architecture yielded a model
with six hidden layers, each containing 512 nodes, provides an optimized
balance between accuracy and computational complexity. Extensive testing
enabled us to establish ANN's applicability limits and to quantify the
systematic and statistical errors associated with using such networks for EB
analysis. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of dilution effects in
parameter estimation for EBs, and we outline methods to incorporate these
effects in AI-based models.
  This proposed ANN framework enables a speedup of over four orders of
magnitude compared to traditional methods, with systematic errors not exceeding
1\%, and often as low as 0.01\%, across the entire parameter space.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12244v1"><h2>ChronoFlow: A Data-Driven Model for Gyrochronology</h2></a>Authors:  Phil R. Van-Lane, Joshua S. Speagle, Gwendolyn M. Eadie, Stephanie T. Douglas, Phillip A. Cargile, Catherine Zucker, Yuxi, Lu, Ruth Angus</br>Comments: 40 pages, 28 figures (including appendices)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Gyrochronology is a technique for constraining stellar ages using rotation
periods, which change over a star's main sequence lifetime due to magnetic
braking. This technique shows promise for main sequence FGKM stars, where other
methods are imprecise. However, models have historically struggled to capture
the observed rotational dispersion in stellar populations. To properly
understand this complexity, we have assembled the largest standardized data
catalog of rotators in open clusters to date, consisting of ~7,400 stars across
30 open clusters/associations spanning ages of 1.5 Myr to 4 Gyr. We have also
developed ChronoFlow: a flexible data-driven model which accurately captures
observed rotational dispersion. We show that ChronoFlow can be used to
accurately forward model rotational evolution, and to infer both cluster and
individual stellar ages. We recover cluster ages with a statistical uncertainty
of 0.06 dex ($\approx$ 15%), and individual stellar ages with a statistical
uncertainty of 0.7 dex. Additionally, we conducted robust systematic tests to
analyze the impact of extinction models, cluster membership, and calibration
ages on our model's performance. These contribute an additional $\approx$ 0.06
dex of uncertainty in cluster age estimates, resulting in a total error budget
of 0.08 dex. We estimate ages for the NGC 6709 open cluster and the Theia 456
stellar stream, and calculate revised rotational ages for M34, NGC 2516, NGC
1750, and NGC 1647. Our results show that ChronoFlow can precisely estimate the
ages of coeval stellar populations, and constrain ages for individual stars.
Furthermore, its predictions may be used to inform physical spin down models.

  variational autoencoders</h2></a>Authors:  Irham T. Andika, Stefan Schuldt, Sherry H. Suyu, Satadru Bag, Raoul Cañameras, Alejandra Melo, Claudio Grillo, James H. H. Chan</br>Comments: Submitted to the Astronomy & Astrophysics journal. The paper consists
  of 17 main pages, 14 figures, and 5 tables. We welcome feedback and comments
  from readers!</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, cs.CV, cs.LG</br><p>Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic
expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the
characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images
is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this
challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built
upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly
integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object
classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach
to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1)
the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a
singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius
($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds
using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional
lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within
$2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}<3$ arcsecs. To identify new
lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80
million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from
various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating
$z>1.5$ sources, the number of candidates is reduced to 710,966. Subsequently,
VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a
lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates
that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential
of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong
lenses in large datasets.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13727v1"><h2>Open Superclusters II. Discovery of an Inactive Supercluster Including a
  New Open Cluster in the Solar Neighborhood</h2></a>Authors:  Juan Casado, Yasser Hendy, Nikola Faltova, Dana Kovaleva</br>Comments: 22 pages, 2 tables, 11 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, astro-ph.GA, physics.data-an</br><p>We investigate the existence and properties of open superclusters within 500
pc of the Sun, with a particular focus on a newly identified OSC, designated
HC8. Utilizing Gaia-derived advanced astrometric data and star cluster
catalogs, we identify and analyze the member stars of various open clusters
(OCs), deriving key parameters such as ages, distances, extinctions, and
kinematic properties. Our findings reveal that HC8, a previously unrecognized
OSC, encompasses several young clusters, including the newly discovered OC
Duvia 1. We provide a detailed examination of HC8's star formation history and
its spatial and kinematic characteristics. This study contributes to the
growing body of evidence supporting the existence of primordial groups and
enhances our understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters in
the Galaxy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10678v1"><h2>Efficient Summation of Arbitrary Masks -- ESAM</h2></a>Authors:  Vivek Gupta, Keith Bannister, Chris Flynn, Clancy James</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>Searches for impulsive, astrophysical transients are often highly
computationally demanding. A notable example is the dedispersion process
required for performing blind searches for Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) in radio
telescope data. We introduce a novel approach - Efficient Summation of
Arbitrary Masks (ESAM) - which efficiently computes 1-D convolution of many
arbitrary 2-D masks, and can be used to carry out dedispersion over thousands
of dispersion trials efficiently. Our method matches the accuracy of the
traditional brute force technique in recovering the desired Signal-to-Noise
ratio (S/N) while reducing computational cost by around a factor of 10. We
compare its performance with existing dedispersion algorithms, such as the Fast
Dispersion Measure Transform (FDMT) algorithm, and demonstrate how ESAM
provides freedom to choose arbitrary masks and further optimise computational
cost versus accuracy. We explore the potential applications of ESAM beyond FRB
searches.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13973v1"><h2>Model-Agnostic Cosmological Inference with SDSS-IV eBOSS: Simultaneous
  Probing for Background and Perturbed Universe</h2></a>Authors:  Purba Mukherjee, Anjan A. Sen</br>Comments: 13 pages, 7 sets of figures, 3 tables. Comments are welcome</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, gr-qc</br><p>Here we explore certain subtle features imprinted in data from the completed
Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (eBOSS) as a combined probe for the background and perturbed Universe.
We reconstruct the baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and Redshift Space
Distortion (RSD) observables as functions of redshift, using measurements from
SDSS alone. We apply the Multi-Task Gaussian Process (MTGP) framework to model
the interdependencies of cosmological observables $D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$,
and $f\sigma_8(z)$, and track their evolution across different redshifts.
Subsequently, we obtain constrained three-dimensional phase space containing
$D_M(z)/r_d$, $D_H(z)/r_d$, and $f\sigma_8(z)$ at different redshifts probed by
the SDSS-IV eBOSS survey. Furthermore, assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model, we
obtain constraints on model parameters $\Omega_{m}$, $H_{0}r_{d}$, $\sigma_{8}$
and $S_{8}$ at each redshift probed by SDSS-IV eBOSS. This indicates
redshift-dependent trends in $H_0$, $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$ in the
$\Lambda$CDM model, suggesting a possible inconsistency in the $\Lambda$CDM
model. Ours is a template for model-independent extraction of information for
both background and perturbed Universe using a single galaxy survey taking into
account all the existing correlations between background and perturbed
observables and this can be easily extended to future DESI-3YR as well as
Euclid results.</p></br>
