  Magnitude with a Transformer-Based Machine Learning Model</h2></a>Authors:  Isaac Malsky, Tiffany Kataria, Natasha E. Batalha, Matthew Graham</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Radiative transfer calculations are essential for modeling planetary
atmospheres. However, standard methods are computationally demanding and impose
accuracy-speed trade-offs. High computational costs force numerical
simplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade
the accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal
candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined
physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and
high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations.
We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer
neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of
solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric
two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of ~1% compared to the
traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x. Emulating radiative transfer
with machine learning opens up the possibility for faster and more accurate
routines within planetary atmospheric models such as GCMs.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27146v1"><h2>SERVIMON: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance and Real-Time Monitoring for
  Astronomical Observatories</h2></a>Authors:  Emilio Mastriani, Alessandro Costa, Federico Incardona, Kevin Munari, Sebastiano Spinello</br>Comments: Accepted for publication in IAU Symposium 397: Exploring the Universe
  with Artificial Intelligence (UniversAI 2025), Cambridge University Press.
  Editors: C. Sterken, J. Hearnshaw & D. Valls-Gabaud</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Objective: ServiMon is designed to offer a scalable and intelligent pipeline
for data collection and auditing to monitor distributed astronomical systems
such as the ASTRI Mini-Array. The system enhances quality control, predictive
maintenance, and real-time anomaly detection for telescope operations. Methods:
ServiMon integrates cloud-native technologies-including Prometheus, Grafana,
Cassandra, Kafka, and InfluxDB-for telemetry collection and processing. It
employs machine learning algorithms, notably Isolation Forest, to detect
anomalies in Cassandra performance metrics. Key indicators such as read/write
latency, throughput, and memory usage are continuously monitored, stored as
time-series data, and preprocessed for feature engineering. Anomalies detected
by the model are logged in InfluxDB v2 and accessed via Flux for real-time
monitoring and visualization. Results: AI-based anomaly detection increases
system resilience by identifying performance degradation at an early stage,
minimizing downtime, and optimizing telescope operations. Additionally,
ServiMon supports astrostatistical analysis by correlating telemetry with
observational data, thus enhancing scientific data quality. AI-generated alerts
also improve real-time monitoring, enabling proactive system management.
Conclusion: ServiMon's scalable framework proves effective for predictive
maintenance and real-time monitoring of astronomical infrastructures. By
leveraging cloud and edge computing, it is adaptable to future large-scale
experiments, optimizing both performance and cost. The combination of machine
learning and big data analytics makes ServiMon a robust and flexible solution
for modern and next-generation observational astronomy.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26593v1"><h2>Hybrid Physical-Neural Simulator for Fast Cosmological Hydrodynamics</h2></a>Authors:  Arne Thomsen, Tilman Tröster, François Lanusse</br>Comments: Accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Machine Learning and the
  Physical Sciences</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, cs.LG</br><p>Cosmological field-level inference requires differentiable forward models
that solve the challenging dynamics of gas and dark matter under hydrodynamics
and gravity. We propose a hybrid approach where gravitational forces are
computed using a differentiable particle-mesh solver, while the hydrodynamics
are parametrized by a neural network that maps local quantities to an effective
pressure field. We demonstrate that our method improves upon alternative
approaches, such as an Enthalpy Gradient Descent baseline, both at the field
and summary-statistic level. The approach is furthermore highly data efficient,
with a single reference simulation of cosmological structure formation being
sufficient to constrain the neural pressure model. This opens the door for
future applications where the model is fit directly to observational data,
rather than a training set of simulations.</p></br>
