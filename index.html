Simões, Pierluigi Casale, Marília Felismino, Kai Hou Yip, Ingo P. Waldmann, Giovanna Tinetti, Theresa Lueftinger</br>Comments: To appear in "Proceedings of SPAICE 2024: 1st ESA/IAA conference on
  AI in and for Space". Conference page at https://spaice.esa.int/</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, I.2.6; I.5.1; I.6.4; J.2</br><p>Safe operation of machine learning models requires architectures that
explicitly delimit their operational ranges. We evaluate the ability of anomaly
detection algorithms to provide indicators correlated with degraded model
performance. By placing acceptance thresholds over such indicators, hard
boundaries are formed that define the model's coverage. As a use case, we
consider the extraction of exoplanetary spectra from transit light curves,
specifically within the context of ESA's upcoming Ariel mission. Isolation
Forests are shown to effectively identify contexts where prediction models are
likely to fail. Coverage/error trade-offs are evaluated under conditions of
data and concept drift. The best performance is seen when Isolation Forests
model projections of the prediction model's explainability SHAP values.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03691v1"><h2>Generative Design of Periodic Orbits in the Restricted Three-Body
  Problem</h2></a>Authors:  Alvaro Francisco Gil, Walther Litteri, Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez, David Camacho, Massimiliano Vasile</br>Comments: SPAICE Conference 2024 (7 pages)</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.EP, cs.AI</br><p>The Three-Body Problem has fascinated scientists for centuries and it has
been crucial in the design of modern space missions. Recent developments in
Generative Artificial Intelligence hold transformative promise for addressing
this longstanding problem. This work investigates the use of Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) and its internal representation to generate periodic orbits.
We utilize a comprehensive dataset of periodic orbits in the Circular
Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) to train deep-learning architectures that
capture key orbital characteristics, and we set up physical evaluation metrics
for the generated trajectories. Through this investigation, we seek to enhance
the understanding of how Generative AI can improve space mission planning and
astrodynamics research, leading to novel, data-driven approaches in the field.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03445v1"><h2>Spacecraft inertial parameters estimation using time series clustering
  and reinforcement learning</h2></a>Authors:  Konstantinos Platanitis, Miguel Arana-Catania, Leonardo Capicchiano, Saurabh Upadhyay, Leonard Felicetti</br>Comments: 6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table. To be presented in ESA - AI for Space
  (SPAICE)</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, cs.RO</br><p>This paper presents a machine learning approach to estimate the inertial
parameters of a spacecraft in cases when those change during operations, e.g.
multiple deployments of payloads, unfolding of appendages and booms, propellant
consumption as well as during in-orbit servicing and active debris removal
operations. The machine learning approach uses time series clustering together
with an optimised actuation sequence generated by reinforcement learning to
facilitate distinguishing among different inertial parameter sets. The
performance of the proposed strategy is assessed against the case of a
multi-satellite deployment system showing that the algorithm is resilient
towards common disturbances in such kinds of operations.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02063v1"><h2>On marginals and profiled posteriors for cosmological parameter
  estimation</h2></a>Authors:  Martin Kerscher, Jochen Weller</br>Comments: 21 pages, 10 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an</br><p>With several examples and in an analysis of the Pantheon+ supernova sample we
discuss the properties of the marginal posterior distribution versus the
profiled posterior distribution -- the profile likelihood in a Bayesian
disguise. We investigate whether maximisation, as used for the profiling, or
integration, as used for the marginalisation, is more appropriate. To report
results we recommend the marginal posterior distribution.</p></br>
