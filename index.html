  Simulation-based Inference</h2></a>Authors:  Nicolas Mediato-Diaz, Will Handley</br>Comments: 12 pages, 7 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an, stat.ML</br><p>We develop the framework of Linear Simulation-based Inference (LSBI), an
application of simulation-based inference where the likelihood is approximated
by a Gaussian linear function of its parameters. We obtain analytical
expressions for the posterior distributions of hyper-parameters of the linear
likelihood in terms of samples drawn from a simulator, for both uniform and
conjugate priors. This method is applied sequentially to several toy-models and
tested on emulated datasets for the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature
power spectrum. We find that convergence is achieved after four or five rounds
of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ simulations, which is competitive with state-of-the-art
neural density estimation methods. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is
possible to obtain significant information gain and generate posteriors that
agree with the underlying parameters while maintaining explainability and
intellectual oversight.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02473v1"><h2>IRIS: A Bayesian Approach for Image Reconstruction in Radio
  Interferometry with expressive Score-Based priors</h2></a>Authors:  No√© Dia, M. J. Yantovski-Barth, Alexandre Adam, Micah Bowles, Laurence Perreault-Levasseur, Yashar Hezaveh, Anna Scaife</br>Comments: 17 pages, 8 figures, submitted to the Astrophysical Journal</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, eess.IV</br><p>Inferring sky surface brightness distributions from noisy interferometric
data in a principled statistical framework has been a key challenge in radio
astronomy. In this work, we introduce Imaging for Radio Interferometry with
Score-based models (IRIS). We use score-based models trained on optical images
of galaxies as an expressive prior in combination with a Gaussian likelihood in
the uv-space to infer images of protoplanetary disks from visibility data of
the DSHARP survey conducted by ALMA. We demonstrate the advantages of this
framework compared with traditional radio interferometry imaging algorithms,
showing that it produces plausible posterior samples despite the use of a
misspecified galaxy prior. Through coverage testing on simulations, we
empirically evaluate the accuracy of this approach to generate calibrated
posterior samples.</p></br>
