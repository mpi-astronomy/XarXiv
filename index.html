  spectroscopic surveys</h2></a>Authors:  Shreya Sareen, Swayamtrupta Panda</br>Comments: 4 pages, 1 figure, submitted to AAS journals</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the
universe, making them valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However,
understanding how AGN properties evolve over cosmic time remains a fundamental
challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low redshift (nearby) can
serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying
spectral 'doppelg\"angers', AGNs with remarkably similar emission line
properties despite being separated by vast cosmic distances. We analyze key
spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data
Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C
IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (H$\beta$), and Iron (Fe II - optical and
UV) emission lines. We incorporated properties such as equivalent width,
velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half maximum (FWHM), and
continuum luminosities (135nm, 300nm, and 510nm) closest to these prominent
lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly
similar spectra, hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share
intrinsic properties with high-redshift ones. We showcase here one of the
better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00763v1"><h2>JFlow: Model-Independent Spherical Jeans Analysis using Equivariant
  Continuous Normalizing Flows</h2></a>Authors:  Sung Hak Lim, Kohei Hayashi, Shun'ichi Horigome, Shigeki Matsumoto, Mihoko M. Nojiri</br>Comments: 9 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.GA</br>All Categories: astro-ph.GA, astro-ph.CO, cs.LG, hep-ex, hep-ph</br><p>The kinematics of stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies have been studied to
understand the structure of dark matter halos. However, the kinematic
information of these stars is often limited to celestial positions and
line-of-sight velocities, making full phase space analysis challenging.
Conventional methods rely on projected analytic phase space density models with
several parameters and infer dark matter halo structures by solving the
spherical Jeans equation. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised machine
learning method for solving the spherical Jeans equation in a model-independent
way as a first step toward model-independent analysis of dwarf spheroidal
galaxies. Using equivariant continuous normalizing flows, we demonstrate that
spherically symmetric stellar phase space densities and velocity dispersions
can be estimated without model assumptions. As a proof of concept, we apply our
method to Gaia challenge datasets for spherical models and measure dark matter
mass densities given velocity anisotropy profiles. Our method can identify halo
structures accurately, even with a small number of tracer stars.</p></br>
