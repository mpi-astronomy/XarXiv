  CubeSat</h2></a>Authors:  Keenan A. A. Chatar, Ezra Fielding, Kei Sano, Kentaro Kitamura</br>Comments: 14 pages</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG</br><p>Nanosatellites are proliferating as low-cost dedicated sensing systems with
lean development cycles. Kyushu Institute of Technology and collaborators have
launched a joint venture for a nanosatellite mission, VERTECS. The primary
mission is to elucidate the formation history of stars by observing the
optical-wavelength cosmic background radiation. The VERTECS satellite will be
equipped with a small-aperture telescope and a high-precision attitude control
system to capture the cosmic data for analysis on the ground. However,
nanosatellites are limited by their onboard memory resources and downlink speed
capabilities. Additionally, due to a limited number of ground stations, the
satellite mission will face issues meeting the required data budget for mission
success. To alleviate this issue, we propose an on-orbit system to autonomously
classify and then compress desirable image data for data downlink
prioritization and optimization. The system comprises a prototype Camera
Controller Board (CCB) which carries a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 which is
used for classification and compression. The system uses a lightweight
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify and determine the
desirability of captured image data. The model is designed to be lean and
robust to reduce the computational and memory load on the satellite. The model
is trained and tested on a novel star field dataset consisting of data captured
by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The dataset is meant to simulate the
expected data produced by the 6U satellite. The compression step implements
GZip, RICE or HCOMPRESS compression, which are standards for astronomical data.
Preliminary testing on the proposed CNN model results in a classification
accuracy of about 100\% on the star field dataset, with compression ratios of
3.99, 5.16 and 5.43 for GZip, RICE and HCOMPRESS that were achieved on tested
FITS image data.</p></br>
