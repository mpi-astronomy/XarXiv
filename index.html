  Analysis</h2></a>Authors:  Zhixin Guo, Qi Shi, Xiaofan Xu, Sixiang Shan, Limin Qin, Linqiang Ge, Rui Zhang, Ya Dai, Hua Zhu, Guowei Jiang</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.EP</br>All Categories: astro-ph.EP, astro-ph.IM, cs.AI</br><p>With the rapid advancement of aerospace technology and the large-scale
deployment of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, the challenges
facing astronomical observations and deep space exploration have become
increasingly pronounced. As a result, the demand for high-precision orbital
data on space objects-along with comprehensive analyses of satellite
positioning, constellation configurations, and deep space satellite
dynamics-has grown more urgent. However, there remains a notable lack of
publicly accessible, real-world datasets to support research in areas such as
space object maneuver behavior prediction and collision risk assessment. This
study seeks to address this gap by collecting and curating a representative
dataset of maneuvering behavior from Starlink satellites. The dataset
integrates Two-Line Element (TLE) catalog data with corresponding
high-precision ephemeris data, thereby enabling a more realistic and
multidimensional modeling of space object behavior. It provides valuable
insights into practical deployment of maneuver detection methods and the
evaluation of collision risks in increasingly congested orbital environments.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.12230v1"><h2>Statistical Machine Learning for Astronomy -- A Textbook</h2></a>Authors:  Yuan-Sen Ting</br>Comments: 677 pages, 152 figures. Code and tutorials available at
  https://github.com/tingyuansen/statml</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, stat.AP, stat.ML</br><p>This textbook provides a systematic treatment of statistical machine learning
for astronomical research through the lens of Bayesian inference, developing a
unified framework that reveals connections between modern data analysis
techniques and traditional statistical methods. We show how these techniques
emerge from familiar statistical foundations. The consistently Bayesian
perspective prioritizes uncertainty quantification and statistical rigor
essential for scientific inference in astronomy. The textbook progresses from
probability theory and Bayesian inference through supervised learning including
linear regression with measurement uncertainties, logistic regression, and
classification. Unsupervised learning topics cover Principal Component Analysis
and clustering methods. We then introduce computational techniques through
sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, followed by Gaussian Processes as
probabilistic nonparametric methods and neural networks within the broader
statistical context. Our theory-focused pedagogical approach derives each
method from first principles with complete mathematical development,
emphasizing statistical insight and complementing with astronomical
applications. We prioritize understanding why algorithms work, when they are
appropriate, and how they connect to broader statistical principles. The
treatment builds toward modern techniques including neural networks through a
solid foundation in classical methods and their theoretical underpinnings. This
foundation enables thoughtful application of these methods to astronomical
research, ensuring proper consideration of assumptions, limitations, and
uncertainty propagation essential for advancing astronomical knowledge in the
era of large astronomical surveys.</p></br>
