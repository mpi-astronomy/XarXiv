Simões, Pierluigi Casale, Marília Felismino, Kai Hou Yip, Ingo P. Waldmann, Giovanna Tinetti, Theresa Lueftinger</br>Comments: To appear in "Proceedings of SPAICE 2024: 1st ESA/IAA conference on
  AI in and for Space". Conference page at https://spaice.esa.int/</br>Primary Category: cs.LG</br>All Categories: cs.LG, astro-ph.IM, I.2.6; I.5.1; I.6.4; J.2</br><p>Safe operation of machine learning models requires architectures that
explicitly delimit their operational ranges. We evaluate the ability of anomaly
detection algorithms to provide indicators correlated with degraded model
performance. By placing acceptance thresholds over such indicators, hard
boundaries are formed that define the model's coverage. As a use case, we
consider the extraction of exoplanetary spectra from transit light curves,
specifically within the context of ESA's upcoming Ariel mission. Isolation
Forests are shown to effectively identify contexts where prediction models are
likely to fail. Coverage/error trade-offs are evaluated under conditions of
data and concept drift. The best performance is seen when Isolation Forests
model projections of the prediction model's explainability SHAP values.</p></br><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02063v1"><h2>On marginals and profiled posteriors for cosmological parameter
  estimation</h2></a>Authors:  Martin Kerscher, Jochen Weller</br>Comments: 21 pages, 10 figures</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, physics.data-an</br><p>With several examples and in an analysis of the Pantheon+ supernova sample we
discuss the properties of the marginal posterior distribution versus the
profiled posterior distribution -- the profile likelihood in a Bayesian
disguise. We investigate whether maximisation, as used for the profiling, or
integration, as used for the marginalisation, is more appropriate. To report
results we recommend the marginal posterior distribution.</p></br>
