Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce unprecedented volumes of heterogeneous astronomical data (images, catalogs, and alerts) that challenge traditional analysis pipelines. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful, scalable, and operationally reliable. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance. Finally, we discuss critical software, computing, data infrastructure, and human capital requirements for the successful deployment of these new methodologies, and consider associated risks and opportunities for broader coordination with external actors.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14036v1"><h2>Evaluating state-of-the-art cloud quantum computers for quantum neural networks in gravitational waves data analysis</h2></a>Authors:  Maria-Catalina Isfan, Laurentiu-Ioan Caramete, Ana Caramete</br>Comments: No comment found</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.CO</br>All Categories: astro-ph.CO, astro-ph.IM, physics.data-an</br><p>In this work, we explore the possibility of using quantum computers provided for usage in cloud by big companies (such as IBM, IonQ, IQM Quantum Computers, etc.) to run our quantum neural network (QNN) developed for data analysis in the context of LISA Space Mission, developed with the Qiskit library in Python. Our previous work demonstrated that our QNN learns patterns in gravitational wave (GW) data much faster than a classical neural network, making it suitable for fast GW signal detection in future LISA data streams. Analyzing the fees from hardware providers like IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket and Microsoft Azure, we found that the fees for running the first segment of our QNN sum up to \$2000, \$60000, and \$1000000 respectively. Using free plans, we succeed to run the 3-qubit feature map of the QNN for one random data sample on {\fontfamily{qcr} \selectfont ibm\_kyoto} and {\fontfamily{qcr}\selectfont IQM Quantum Computers\_Garnet} quantum computers, obtaining a fidelity of 99\%; we could also run the first prediction segment of our QNN on {\fontfamily{qcr} \selectfont ibm\_kyoto}, implemented for 4 qubits, and obtained a prediction accuracy of 20\%. We queried providers such as IBM Quantum, Amazon Braket, Pasqal, and Munich Quantum Valley to obtain access to their plans, but, with the exception of Amazon Braket, our applications remain unanswered to this day. Other major setbacks in using the quantum computers we had access to included Qiskit library version issues (as in the cases of IBM Quantum and IQM Quantum Computers) and the frequent unavailability of the devices, as was the case with the Microsoft Azure provider. All the results presented in this paper were accumulated in 2024.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11415v1"><h2>Zero-Shot Detection of Elastic Transient Morphology Across Physical Systems</h2></a>Authors:  Jose Sánchez Andreu</br>Comments: 17 pages, 6 figures. Supplemental material included</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.IM</br>All Categories: astro-ph.IM, cs.LG, physics.data-an</br><p>We test whether a representation learned from interferometric strain transients in gravitational-wave observatories can act as a frozen morphology-sensitive operator for unseen sensors, provided the target signals preserve coherent elastic transient structure. Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels.
  On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer.
  Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features. Controlled morphology-destruction transformations selectively degrade performance despite per-window normalization, consistent with sensitivity to coherent time-frequency organization rather than marginal amplitude statistics.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13145v1"><h2>SolARED: Solar Active Region Emergence Dataset for Machine Learning Aided Predictions</h2></a>Authors:  Spiridon Kasapis, Eren Dogan, Irina N. Kitiashvili, Alexander G. Kosovichev, John T. Stefan, Jake D. Butler, Jonas Tirona, Sarang Patil, Mengjia Xu</br>Comments: 15 pages, 6 figures, submitted to the Springer Nature - Solar Physics Journal</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>The development of accurate forecasts of solar eruptive activity has become increasingly important for preventing potential impacts on space technologies and exploration. Therefore, it is crucial to detect Active Regions (ARs) before they start forming on the solar surface. This will enable the development of early-warning capabilities for upcoming space weather disturbances. For this reason, we prepared the Solar Active Region Emergence Dataset (SolARED). The dataset is derived from full-disk maps of the Doppler velocity, magnetic field, and continuum intensity, obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). SolARED includes time series of remapped, tracked, and binned data that characterize the evolution of acoustic power of solar oscillations, unsigned magnetic flux, and continuum intensity for 50 large ARs before, during, and after their emergence on the solar surface, as well as surrounding areas observed on the solar disc between 2010 and 2023. The resulting ML-ready SolARED dataset is designed to support enhancements of predictive capabilities, enabling the development of operational forecasts for the emergence of active regions. The SolARED dataset is available at https://sun.njit.edu/sarportal/, through an interactive visualization web application.</p></br><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13144v1"><h2>Forecasting Continuum Intensity for Solar Active Region Emergence Prediction using Transformers</h2></a>Authors:  Jonas Tirona, Sarang Patil, Spiridon Kasapis, Eren Dogan, John Stefan, Irina N. Kitiashvili, Alexander G. Kosovichev, Mengjia Xu</br>Comments: 30 pages, 7 figures, submitted to JGR: Machine Learning and Computation</br>Primary Category: astro-ph.SR</br>All Categories: astro-ph.SR, cs.LG</br><p>Early and accurate prediction of solar active region (AR) emergence is crucial for space weather forecasting. Building on established Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based approaches for forecasting the continuum intensity decrease associated with AR emergence, this work expands the modeling with new architectures and targets. We investigate a sliding-window Transformer architecture to forecast continuum intensity evolution up to 12 hours ahead using data from 46 ARs observed by SDO/HMI. We conduct a systematic ablation study to evaluate two key components: (1) the inclusion of a temporal 1D convolutional (Conv1D) front-end and (2) a novel `Early Detection' architecture featuring attention biases and a timing-aware loss function. Our best-performing model, combining the Early Detection architecture without the Conv1D layer, achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.1189 (representing a 10.6% improvement over the LSTM baseline) and an average advance warning time of 4.73 hours (timing difference of -4.73h), even under a stricter emergence criterion than previous studies. While the Transformer demonstrates superior aggregate timing and accuracy, we note that this high-sensitivity detection comes with increased variance compared to smoother baseline models. However, this volatility is a necessary trade-off for operational warning systems: the model's ability to detect micro-changes in precursor signals enables significantly earlier detection, outweighing the cost of increased noise. Our results demonstrate that Transformer architectures modified with early detection biases, when used without temporal smoothing layers, provide a high-sensitivity alternative for forecasting AR emergence that prioritizes advance warning over statistical smoothness.</p></br>
