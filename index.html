astrophysical events, such as binary black hole mergers. However, their high
sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure
these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called "glitches"
that can mimic astrophysical signals or mask their characteristics. Fast and
accurate reconstruction of both signals and glitches is crucial for reliable
scientific inference. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning
framework designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding
interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to
model the inherent noise distribution of GW interferometers, following
conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short
time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of
the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction. Our approach achieves
superior generalization capabilities for arbitrary signals and glitches
compared to methods that directly map inputs to the clean training waveforms.
We validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1)
reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2)
comparing performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3)
analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective
glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. DeepExtractor achieves a median
mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep
learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch
recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one
glitch sample in approx. 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's
processing time of approx. one hour per glitch.</p></br>
